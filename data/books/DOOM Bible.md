Each game can end three ways: User Abort, player death with no lives left, and player

victory. Each is covered here. Where the episodes differ (like the cinematics), you will

find the necessary information in the “Unique Bits” section of each episode.

END OF GAME: USER ABORT

When the user invokes the during-game Abort, a prompt window appears asking

them to verify. If they say yes, the guy dies in maze and control panel appears.

END OF GAME: DEATH

Pull back to see self die, view remains in maze. Window over view of dead guy –

choice to continue If you don’t Control Panel over view.

6 . C h a r a c t e r s

These are the four characters in Doom:

**Lorelei Chen**

Age: 27

Weight: 151

Height: 5’10”

Physical Description: Muscular, tall woman, attractive, but has strangely too-intense

eyes. Oriental featured in the brown eyes and black hair, which is drawn back into a

large knot. Scar on left shoulder from rock-climbing accident.

Character Description: Fiercely competitive, Lorelei intimidates most people. She won

her troop boxing championship. Lost a bet that meant she had to pull her application for

a glory post. Too late to reapply, she got this post. Married for six months once, husband

divorced her for irreconcilable differences. From European Alliance. No one calls her

Lorelei.

Advantages: Fast. Crack shot with pistol.

Disadvantages: Once wounded, she still tends to push herself to compensate, so wounds

can keep ticking off more. Not used to bayonet.

**John “Petro” Pietrovich**

Age: 34

Weight: 190

Height: 5’9”

Physical Description: Black balding man with thick eyebrows. Missing last joint of right

ring finger. Brown eyes.

Character Description: Former head of security at AWR (Advanced Weapons Research)

Labs, Petro grew tired of the overwhelming bureaucracy of the UAAF. His

insubordination cost him his rank, and his assignment on Tei Tenga was his request,

made to get away from the epicenter of annoyance while finishing out his term of duty.

Advantages: Good with standard shell weapons. Can take damage.

Disadvantages: Average speed. Not used to missile weapons.

**Dimitri Paramo**

Age: 37

Weight: 191

Height: 5’11”

Physical Description: Bulky, slightly overweight greek-spaniard with swarthy but

unkempt looks. Frizzly dark brown hair explodes and falls off his head.

Character Description: Dimitri is basically stuck in the low ranks of the military, but that

suits him just fine. He wants nothing more from life: give him a clear objective and the

chance to release aggression through the freely available high-powered firearms, and he’s

happy.

Advantages: Very good with a ll weapons. Can take a lot of damage.

Disadvantages: Slow.



<a name="br9"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 6

**Thi Barrett**

Age: 22

Weight: 130

Height: 5’6”

Physical Description: Red-haired and trim, Thi (Pronounced “Tee”) has piercing blue

eyes, and is stout but gorgeous. A toss of hair tends to fall over her forehead. She holds

a bewitching dimpled smile in reserve until it proves useful.

Character Description: Thi has a friendly, if straight-laced, disposition. Father was a

sargeant in the UAAF, a career soldier that gave Thi a strong sense of duty and honor.

Medalist in unarmed combat competition. She volunteered for this post because no one

wanted it, and with a desire to have a variety of experience in her military life.

Advantages: Faster than Average. Hard to hit. Does incredible damage with bayonet.

Disadvantages: Low hit points.

And of course, theres…

**Buddy Dacote: the guy that dies**

Age: 29

Weight: 202

Height: 6’2”

Physical Description: Very fit and powerful, Buddy always wears a hat that says “BEOS”

which stands for “Butt End of Space.” Caucasian with brown/Blond hair and green eyes.

Character Description: Popular and courageous, Buddy got sent to Tei Tenga Darkside

for showing up a superior officer. His stay here is just temporary though – he was sent

here as a security advisor. Buddy has a good sense of humor. Inside Info: Dacote stands

for “Dies at conclusion of this episode.”

7 .1 S t o r y

Episode One: Evil Unleashed or All Hell Breaks Loose

You are a soldier in the UAAF (United Aerospace Armed Forces) assigned to the

secondary military research base on the darkside of the giant moon Tei Tenga (nicknamed

“the Butt End of Space”). You and four friends are having a game of cards in the hangar

bay. One of your friends leaves to go on shift.

Meanwhile, the research team are doing experiments at the anomalies found on the

moon. There is a flash of horrible light and energy and two gates open at equidistant points

on the moon’s surface, the larger of the two at the lightside. Every awake is quickly killed.

One reaching for the alarm button has his hand chopped off. Briefly your friend is

grabbed, his hat falling off in the lab. Then they spread out through the airducts and

possessing sleeping people with magic.

A short while later, a strange alien creature bursts into the room. (“What the hell?”)

A fight ensures. Whoever’s left in your squad investigates the base, where a dark tale

begins to unfold. A bunch of small hostile alien creatures have invaded the base. Strange

symbols are drawn everywhere in the blood of dead soldiers and scientists. The more you

go forward, the stranger and grosser the walls become. One your way, you find your

friend’s cap.

After you make it to the control lab. You also find a gate to another place in the

wreckage of what was a containment chamber. One the other side, you find two huge

beasts in a circular natural rock canyon and the remains of the lab team. Between the

beasts is your friend and they quarter him. You defeat the beasts, turn to leave, only to find

the hole closing! You’re trapped here! You climb the rock walls, and look at your

surroundings from the top of this extinct volcano: “Oh, hell…”

Other players will look similar, but their suits will be of different colors. Other color

changes will reflect different weapons and in the commercial game, helmets.

Demon-Possessed Humans

Once human, these poor folks were possessed in their sleep. Their uniforms can be

palette changed to reflect different behavior.

Flying Imps

Annoying little bastards, the imps come in different flavors, with later ones firing

spikes and fire.

Demon Troops

These guys do a lot of damage up close. Later Troops cast magic.

Demon Sargeants

These guys do a lot more damage up close. Later sargeant cast floor-boiling magic.

7 .3 Un iq u e Bit s

Unique to this episode are the following things.

Setting

The bases on the planet Tei Tenga used to be the glory posts, but lack of progress with the

research has cased money to be funneled away to the point of its current staff – a group of

dedicated, almost messianic scientists and a skeleton crew of security people.

The two bases are Lightside and darkside: the planet does not rotate, so there is no day

or night. The anomalies being studied are on the planet’s magnetic poles.

Intro Cinematic

The intro cinematic goes like this (a lot of pictures are repeated, so don't worry):

View from space of planet (ballmapped):

Military research base, moon Tei Tenga (rotates)

(shows "Lightside" and "darkside", then rotates to darkside and zooms in and fades out)

Zoom into room with live guys playing cards. Small pictures of each of their eyes

blinking, looking to other side. Back to main view.

Dacote: I'm out. I gotta go on duty anyway. See you guys.

Petro: Pay-up or die, Buddy.

Dacote (leaving, door shuts): I'll pay you after my shift, Petro. I got some money hid.



<a name="br13"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

View of side of moon. Sparks and red light at both bases.

Lorelei: Would you go, Paramo?

See frightened faces of lab guys, flashed and faded out.

Close-up on eyes again.

Paramo: Leave me alone.

Hand reaches for alarm, chopped off (Both in strobe flash.)

Thi Barrett: Such an indecisive wimp, eh Chen?

Paramo: Stow it, Barrett. All right, I’ll go ... (pause) gimme all your twos.

Buddy looks back and forth in strobe, see demon claw behind him.

See players in silhouette as door to room opens behind them with backlit demon.

Flash of their terrified faces.

Close-up of demon's eyes fades down to title background. Goes to credits.

Credits roll over demon face.

Face scales toward screen as it fades out.

End Cinematic

The end cinematic shows the dead twin demons. Cut to close up of player, then comment

from other live players. (Actually, probably just shot of them atop cliff, and just drawing

the ones left.)

Show parallaxing pan of Hell.

Cut to player close-up: "Oh, hell...

Short credit-like roll hyping Doom 2 over scary demon lord's face. Eyes open and big

word "Doom" appears masked over it. Fade to black.

Go to high scores, then Demo Loop.

Solution

Go through Depot 2, Mess toOfficers' Quarters. Get a Colonel's Hand. Use the Colonel's

Hand to get into the control center. Get through Power Plant maze and trip the breakers.

Power turns on. Use the Colonel's hand to gain access to the Lab (though monorail system,

which is dangerous, because there's a lot of demons and not a lot of health) or through main

lab entrance. Fight your way through the lab to the Anomaly passage, using the Colonel's

Hand. Go down there, and kick some twin demon butt.

7 .3 .1 DO O M BUILDINGS AN D ARE AS :

Epis o d e O n e

This section will show the allocation of puzzles, traps, and POs (photo opportunities,

denoted by a Ä ) in the areas of episode one. There should be at least one of each per floor.

Every area should have interesting stuff to go and explore, if not vital stuff to obtain.

Otherwise, why is it there? Why isn't something cool there instead? Oh, yeah, easter eggs

are noted with a ª .

Graphic Descriptions

Each building has one of these, describing which style of walls are present, and the kind

of feeling, mood, and detail I am looking for.

Styles

**Old:** mining colony original structures, made by Porta-Bild Inc, makers of the Snap-

Snugä line of generic economy pressurized buildings. Some of the shabby, Jabba places

in *Star Wars, Aliens.* (Except looks stuck together.)

**UAC:** Bright shiny, high-tech buildings by StarStruct, Inc. *2001* and *Star Wars’*

Imperial stuff.

**Mine:** Shabby, old, sturdy supports in a energy-carved mine, along with the natural

caves in which the anomaly was found. Gray, red, and brown granites and the like.

**Demon:** The demons have made some areas more “like home.” You know sorta Art

Decomposed. Everything is harsh sharp rock, with living organs in the walls, plus the

occasional glowing bit or tortured soul.

**BUILDING DESCRIPTIONS**

**Hangar Two**

The secondary hangar fell into disuse after the glamour faded from the Tei Tenga bases.

It now stores used up equipment, junk, and the room where the soldiers play cards. Sunk

into wall of canyon. You can see out a window on the second floor.

The hangar has become grungy since it has fallen into disuse.

*Graphic Description*: Hangar is UAC style. However, since it has fallen into disuse, it

is slightly shabbed-out UAC, with the occasional dripline of oil or rust. Not everything is

perfectly ordered. Stains on floor of hangar.

Basement

Large Storage Area: a lot of stuff on palettes. Storage canisters.

Toilet: standard toilet, three stalls. ª Easter Egg: stand in front of toilet close door, wait

(if you have speech 'n' sound pack)-peeing sound.

Elevator: standard fare, only one. If you stay on the elevator long enough,



<a name="br15"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 7

computer voice sounds (“Please do not loiter on the elevator. Thank you.”).

Dispatcher Desk: desk of the dispatcher.

Elevators: from hangar bay.

Monorail: just to depot. One track. You can go this way if you want.

Ground Floor

Hangar Bay: Huge room, with the odd crate. On floor huge 2's and track for landing

ship. Crane above. Crane operator booth opposite doors. It may be possible to open the

doors after the power is turned on. Two big elevator platforms can lower to basement if

power is on.

Main Exit: Leads on a path to Supply Depot Two.

Equipment Room: Locked up Forklift thing, Storage stuff.

Depot Office: Official and messy looking room.

Break Room: Messy, microwave, cabinets, tables, Rolleeä chairs.

Toilets: Stalls have swinging doors (to show that off)

Elevator: to second and basement floors.

Second Floor

ª Hangar Control Room: where they meet to play cards. Large crate surrounded by

small crates. Cards drawn on top of crate. In this room there should be 4-minus-the-

number-of-players bodies on the floor. Can have personal palettes corresponding to who

isn't playing. Map on wall with flashing problem areas. Should be at end of hallway, so

demons are on your way out. Player starts here.

Offices: your basic futuristic offices. Desk, screen on wall, cabinets.

Toilets: need to figure out a generic toilet area to paste everywhere.

Equipment Room: one of the first place to get items.

Communications Room: Neat-o computers set into wall. One extruded control desk.

Elevator. Goes between three floors. Should have up and down and number indicators,

maybe a place for lights to go by like in Star Trek.

Crane Operation: View window out toward crane. Extruded control desk.

Window in hallway: you can see out onto the surface, and the sky. Perhaps a ª here.

**Supply Depot Two**

Still used as a storage depot, but not as active as the main supply depot. Holds lots of stuff.

*Graphic Description*: The supply depot is UAC, in normal UAAF shape because stuff

is still routed from here to the other buildings on the base. The monorail tunnels are dull

and utilitarian.

Basement

Monorail Switcher: from hangar two the underground circuit's two rail system.

Storekeeper's Office: The guy who actually dispenses materiel.

Guard/Operator Desk: Controls access to monorail switcher and elevators.



<a name="br16"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 7

Ground Floor

Storage: Huge rooms, possibly crate maze, or at least important stuff hidden behind

crates. Equivalent of a motor pool is here. Health items hidden in maze. Massive freight

platforms travel to second floor and basement.

Second Floor

More storage, with maze containing storage crates with weapons. Outside, part of the

running track rests on the building

**Waste Processing Facility**

Processes all the waste for the whole facility, splits it into water, nutrients for the lab's

gardens, solid fuel, and a bit of unusable waste which is either jettisoned from the dome or

used by the cook.

*Graphic Description*: This is UAC: pristine on the upper level, but basement is very

grungy near the gross parts. They try to keep it clean, but you know.

Basement

Basement tunnel to the Mess Hall. Huge vats of processing waste. Too bad we are not

in Smell-O-Vision. Billions of bacteria are converting the waste to nicer substances. Waste

processing tanks are large, round, flat deals with a large arm that slowly traces the radius of

the tank. (If no animation, then just bubble the liquid a bit like it is moving.)

Ground Floor

Offices are quite spiffy and neat, in direct contrast to the basement.

**Enlisted Quarters**

Where all the grunts, including our soldiers, sleep, shower, and shit. Have their names

on some lockers, perhaps, or have the lockers respond to them. There are five soldiers for

each shower and toilet.

*Graphic Description*: UAC, but less nurnie covered, because it is just a box to stick

people in. Each desk unit will have electronics, but walls are walls.

Ground Floor

Murphy Beds, Murphy Desks, Lockers, Showers, Bathrooms, Tons of possessed

humans. Lots of dead guys. Elevator to roof. Some items in lockers. Horrible massacre in

shower. There is an access hallway to the monorail system, used to transfer laundry.

Second Floor

An elevator goes down to the quarters. Control box by it. There is a running track going

from here to the training center. They want to keep all the grunts out of the way, and

maintain space efficiency.

**Tower**

Communications tower, this contains a huge antenna, comm equipment, and soon. This

is usually inhabited by robots (non during the game, or at least game one), and is just jam-

packed with dangerous technology (as underneath the efficiency of the UAC design, the

nuts and bolts are sucky, from committees and



<a name="br17"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 7

cost-cutting (profit-increasing) measures. Also, only robots are gonna see it, right?

*Graphic Desctiption*: This is UAC, but is only meant to be traversed by service

robots. The foolish person who enters will find tech dangers up the wazoo. Electrical

flashes, fields, and many other problems are in here. This is really what the UAC stuff

looks like underneath the surface. Check out them circuit boards, then futurize 'em, dangle

some dangerous wires from the ceiling, and you got the idea.

Ground Floor

Supervisor Room: One supervisor is here to keep a human in the loop for all the robotic

maintenance, to guard the place, and to handle special situations.

Maze: This is just one intense maze of tech problems. The player, if brave, can make it

to the Robot Elevator Tube. On the way are many demon corpses.

Second Floor

The second floor houses even more horrible tech traps. Some demons are here,

wounded already. Can they stutter-walk programmatically? Anyway, you must deal with

tech-traps and demons. In a part of the maze is a CRT running through communications

messages, some detailing very criminal proceedings by the UAC.

Basement

Tech traps, demons, and at the end of it, an awesome weapon. Either the missile

launcher, or tons of heat-seeking missiles for it. Probably the latter-we want everyone to

see the cool missiles.

**Recreation and Training Center**

Where the approved recreational activities take place, and where the soldiers train.

*Graphic Description*: This is really high tech and cool. Everything is very efficient and

some bits of the basement are actually stylish. UAC plus some sense of style.

Basement

This contains the recreational facilities and the chapel.

ª Chapel/Theater: Hourly sermons of different religions, and wall panels are changed

to the style of that religion by operating a control in the corner.

Enlisted Club: Contains place for drinking, plus a video game place in the comer. The

vidwalls do not operate until the power is on. Could have demos of future Id

games/projects, like *Aliens* and *Movement*.

Officers' Club: Contains drinking area and place for gambling. You cannot enter this

area without the Colonel's Hand (Officers' Quarters). There's a Stim-Pack cache and a neat

collector's pistol, if we can have weapon quality. If not just some cool stuff, even if it

doesn't fit.

Storage Room: Accessible from the hallway or the kitchen. Contains supplies for the

kitchen and chapel.

Club Storage: Contains alcoholic supplies, Stim-Packs, crates, tables, chairs, and so on.

Monorail: Connects to Control Center.

Big Elevator: Goes to Training level and up to track.



<a name="br18"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 7

Ground Floor

Entrance: Check-in Desk, entrance to Men's and Women's lockers. Behind desk is

access to big elevator.

Men's and Women's Lockers: Locker rooms. A few open cabinets may have supplies in

them. Access to big elevator, so they can go to the track.

Gym: A bunch of gymnastic equipment, exercise floor, etc. are here. Unrenderable ones

could have pictorial symboled cabinets that are locked.

Shooting Range: If the player shoots at a target, demons come out of the darkness

behind it and attack.

Therapist: Hot tubs, rub down tables, etc. for the injured soldier. One for women, one

for men. (You know, in Display PostScript, that looks like "the rapist.”)

Simulator: Huge screen simulator, probably can't get it out of title loop, because that

would require a lot of art. One for women, one for men.

Weight Room: Futuristic extruded Nautilus stuff that is renderable.

Aerobic Training Room: Big area, too bad we can't do mirrors (problem without player

anims in download anyway).

Second Floor

Ä This is a track area, with jump pits, dash tracks, and the big running track.(Can we

mess up the sand in the jump pit?)

**Mess**

Where everyone eats. 'Mere are kitchens, and a pipeline to the Waste Processing Plant.

*Graphic Description*: This building houses both messes, the kitchens, and the laundry.

It is UAC, and the walls are about as sparse as the quarters. The halls look cool, because

visitors might walk through them.

Ground Floor

Large mess halls (the smaller for the officers) plus a tunnel to the Control Center. In the

mess halls are elevators to the kitchen.

Basement

Kitchens: Lots of kitchen stuff, cabinets, industrial microwaves. Also, there is a tunnel

to the waste processing plant for organic garbage.

Stores: Food storage lockers all over.

Ä Freezer: A bunch of frozen guys, perhaps with frozen blood drippings, who got

wounded, tried to hide here, and froze to death.

Laundry: A bunch of extruded washing machines. Huge demon/human melee here.

Maybe some bits hanging out of machines. Lots of demons left, too!

Monorail: goes to officers' and enlisted quarters. Side tunnel heads to ammo room.

**Officers' Quarters**

The COs stay here. It's a bit nicer than the enlisted place, and a locked door leads to the

Ammo Storage.



<a name="br19"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 7

*Graphic Description*: Similar to the enlisted in overall technology and feel, but this is

just nicer to the inhabitants. Stalls in the bathroom for toilets, privacy walls for each bed

and desk.

Ground Floor

Nice beds, desks, bathrooms, and such. There is an amazingly gross massacre in the

quarters. With rotations, there are a bunch of hands impaled on a pike (under a light to

highlight it even more), with a pile of hands around it. These are the Colonels' Hands (and

many other officers' hands), and they get you into secure areas. All the carnage surrounds it

in sort of a blast pattern. Some of it is sprites, some drawn on the floor. I was thinking

about a passcard, but this stands out, and is gross and unsettling. The object will be shown

on the alternate character status screen.

There's an access elevator to the monorail system (for laundry), but the massacre

prevents passage (the door is trashed). There are also guest rooms here for VIPs.

**Personal Storage**

Lucky is the player who figures out how to get in here. There is just lots of stuff here to

shoot demons with. You definitely need the Colonel's Hand, the power must be on, and you

must find the side passage off the monorail system by the quarters.

*Graphic Description*: The store room is grungy UAC. It isn't techy, and some panels

are missing. (Which will be weird, because uncovered holes will actually be patches on the

wall.)

Basement

Ä Monorail Side Passage: A passage from the monorail system, accessible with power

on and the Colonel's Hand. On the walls are cheesecake calendars (how graphic it is

depends on what rating the player has chosen). There are crates and storage containers

loaded with ammo. A ladder or elevator leads to the upper compartment. (It's a good P.O.

for ads, as they will go "I've never seen that!")

Ground Floor

The door to the upper compartment is sparking and malfunctioning. There is fancy

officer stuff here, including the Sawed-off shotgun, which has a wider radius of damage.

An elevator goes down to the monorail area.

**Control Center/Power Plant**

This is the gateway between the everyday side of the base and the restricted, secret, much-

coveted-by-the-player side.

*Graphic Description*: Ooh, so high tech UAC. This is the super-functional, important

heart of the base.

Basement

Contains the tunnel to the restricted side of the base.

Ä Main Power Plant: mazey, full of tech puzzles. Must be navigated to turn on

breakers, so power will run to base.



<a name="br20"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 7

Tool Shop: where everything is repaired (short cut to first breaker here for those with a

Colonel's Hand).

Brig: where naughty soldiers go. Some trapped possessed humans here. Weapons in a

locker here.

Ground Floor

On the normal side, hallways lead to Depot Two, Rec/Training, and Mess.

To get through the main security gates, you need a Colonel's Hand. Through these gates

are the hospital, the elevators, and a second set of gates for the passage to the other side.

Operations: Offices of the nexus of paper pushing and bureaucracy. Many dead.

Hospital: Gee, would there be medikits here? How about a lot of possessed humans,

too? Beds, readouts on wall, cabinets, examination rooms.

Guard Post: guards second set of gates, and coordinates guard activity.

Offices and Storage: and so, desks and crates. Demon problems, guarding ammo and

supplies. Offices handle communications stuff. Could have readout say that something is

missing from tower once you get weapons or mess with info CRT.

**Lab**

Set up for the study of Fire Dust, the anomaly, the moon, and so on. Also contains some

experiments best carried out away from the mainstream.

*Graphic Description*: The lab is mostly UAC, although it was built around the original

miners' refinery and processing plant (right half of basement and ground floor).

Basement

In the basement are some nasty demons. This area is where you must be hit by a nasty

demon so hard that you fly atop a ledge. This leads to the Observatory. The entrance to the

Anomaly Building is here, loaded with the nasties, as you'd expect.

Refinery: Some of this is intact. About a third to a half has been eerily taken over by

demons and turned into a hellish cavern. From the refinery side, you can just see demon

walls blocking the hallway. (Maybe some fire dust in them.)

Fire Dust Processing: the Fire Dust was collected and separated here before it was

shipped off-planet.

Science Computer Lab: contains the complex's science-related computers. A lot of

NeXT-looking computers.

Ground Floor

Main labs for studies. Right half of the building is the old building, and tests are being

conducted on all of their equipment and possessions to see what prolonged exposure means

to people.

Computer Lab: NeXTs, and screens relate to each part of the base.

Guard Desk: One last outpost before the gates leading to the Anomaly building.

Fire Dust Labs: they are screwing with fire dust in every way imaginable.

Guard Post: Surrounds tunnel to Anomaly building. Need a Colonel's Hand.

(Many of the hand-access doorlocks will have bloody handprints-demons ain't stupid,

either.)

Second Floor

Ä Gardens, both hydroponic and terraformed. Provides some of the base's food supply.

This area is mazey and obscured by plants, so it is scary!

Experiment Labs: labs here are dedicated to anti-matter weapons, fusion weapons,

nuclear weapons, radiation tests on animals, and incredible weapons research.

Gate to Observatory: to get over this gate, you must do something very clever. This

combined impact will launch you over the gate. A control on the other side opens it.

**Observatory**

It is an observatory, but full of nasty demons and lots of treasure. Imps got here easily,

and have set up their supplies here.

*Graphic Description*: This is UAC covered with demon stuff.

Ground Floor

There are extruded computers and a bunch of metal that led as a stairway upstairs

(where you can never get). All the stuff is covered in demon hieroglyphics and goo. An

elevator leads down.

Basement

Once a store room, there are a bunch of powerups and weapons. Some powerups don't

help, because theyll wear off before you get back to use them, unless you ran to the

elevator past the demons in the room.

**Supply Depot One**

The main supply depot everything that comes off a ship is stored here, then routed

through the underground tunnels to the other buildings.

*Graphic Description*: This is UAC, but more functional, and dingier as you get to the

back of the storage areas. Bigger hangar, this contains a big crate maze full of awful demon

traps and powerups.

Basement

Access to the underground tunnel network is here.

Ä Monorail, Two elevators, guard desk, Storage Cage, and Offices.

Ground Floor

From the Control Center, you pass by an office, two large elevator platforms, a guard

desk, and can see the storage cage and anomaly gate and guard post.

Second Floor

Two guard posts and two big elevator platforms dominate the main room that leads to

the main hangar, whose entrance is fried and unreachable, unless we just want to have a

cool "ship-in-the-bay" photo opportunity.

Crate Maze: lots of demons and powerups. If we can, I'd like to somehow have a

survivor here, who runs from the player, and speaks of how everyone was possessed. Could

be left out of download version, since he'd look like a player.

Then again, nah.

**Anomaly**

In the bowels of this structure is the anomaly itself, and the entrance to the hell canyon.

You can only reach this structure from the lab's basement.

*Graphic Description*: The top floor is old miner style. The elevator is UAC. Guard

emplacements surround it. The walls are just way thick in the building. The lower level

starts as a mine and grows more demonic as you near the anomaly.

Basement

The caves of Tei Tenga, where Fire Dust was first found and collected. Tons of demons

are here, swarming about. The gate and the canyon await the player. Some of the original

tunnels are blocked by demon goo, making the way circuitous. Luckily, there are signs and

sections to help you. Horrors await around every comer. Fire dust covers the walls near the

anomaly. The hall to the Canyon glows red. The canyon is frightening demonic rock.

Canyon: here are the two Bruiser Brothers demons. Defeat them and you win!

Ground Floor

Guard emplacements, an elevator, and thick, concrete walls.

**Main Hangar**

Where ships usually fly in. You can here from Supply Depot One, if you find the access

tunnel. There's a lot of neat junk in here.

*Graphic Description*: This will probably be cut, so I won't waste time on describing it.

Basement

Ground Floor

You can get to a window and see a cool ship, but you can't get to it 'cause then there would

be rotations...

You fight your way through many aliens. Once you reach the edifice , you find a

gate guarded by a forcefield. You lead a big boss guy there and shoot him,

buffeting him backward into the beam, destroying it. You go through the door and

get to the gate. You storm through and make it back to your own universe, only to

find you're back on Tei Tenga, and the demonic aliens have taken over the lightside

base.

Your team is in jail for destroying the planet: the officials denied tampering with

the forces. You've been promised release as soon as it blows over. Then they

recruit you to explore another gate that the military has opened on the small moon

of ????. The squads they've sent in have lost to the forces there. Demons from the

gate have stolen a new weapon and you've got to get it back. Once there, you

travel hell and find the weapon ... and it’s attached to a huge techno-demon. You

defeat him and cut the weapon off, and find its energy systems non-functional. You

go outside and head for the gate. When you return to the moon, the entire base is

covered with grotesque demonic goo.

the weapon back. In your way is some awful demon deal which you have to be

clever to defeat. You are ready to take off, but decide to do something more

permanent. You put a warhead on a troop carrier with a delayed detonation, and

send it through the gate. It blows and nukes a good bit of Hell. The big General

Demon shakes his head and touches his strange-shaped tactical board, changing

that area to the color of our dimension.

You get back and ask the military if there are any more of these holes. They

say, well, one more, but it is too small to be significant. You ask to check it out, and

want to go in prepared, just in case. They give you your choice of weapons. Your

ship lands. Then we see the hole being enlarged by a demon machine. You hit the

planet, your pilot is killed by a demon. You find the demons overruning the base

and assault the gate and try to stop them at the source after calling for help, saying

you’ll probably have it cleaned up before they get there. You battle strange new

demons, and in the end meet the General Demon, who totally slaughters you if you

try to attack him. You can find a secret way to get behind him and blow up his

machine. You run out and the "cavalry" has arrived. You take off as you order

them to nuke the gate and the planet. We see the General Demon angry as the

radiation blast flies past him, bathed in its light, threatening to awaken the ancient

ones.

Commercial: Chaos Awake

At the start of the game, we see our team on a reunion vacation. Meanwhile the

General demon is awaking the ancient demons. Back on Earth, they see the

horizon change color. Switch to the General arriving with floods of demons, telling

his children to go play. As the world is fighting them, you are sent as a strike team.

You fight your way to the demon's palace and confront him, he announces his plans

and throws you in a cage to watch the destruction. The player must shoot a

machine nearby which explodes and knocks the cage from its perch. He send a few

demons to round you up. The player has a short while to act. The General

Demon's gate opening machine is there. You can see a gauge which he

demostrated how he can play with the aperture with a giant control atop the

machine, but he only messed with it in one direction. Also, there is a gap in the

machine which sparks intermittently. If you shoot a probjectile into the gap, it

sparks constantly and the readout starts moving to the inverse side, the General

goes "What?" as the gate closes and the dimension starts bending inward. The

Ancients are sucked into the machine, and the General is sucked in after trying to

fire magic at it, all with horrible gibbletty mess. The dimension is pulled into the

machine. Once it touches the machine, the machine starts to blow. Briefly, you see

the aperture gauge opening again, then there is a flash.

On Earth, where the gate was we see a big gibletty squirt from the gate which

flashes from existence. After a long pause, we see the team break the surface,

covered with gibs. They look at each other and say something incredibly funny.

At the last, we see them horribly be-medalled, then back on vacation. See flash

on horizon, they look at each other, then rain starts falling. They laugh. The end.

1 4 .1 We a po n s

There are many weapons in doom (with color used for personal palette of player):

Knife (gray). Attachment to the machine pistol. Does minimum damage, more on

back attack.

Machine Pistol (violet). One shot at a time. Has knife attachment for close combat.

Shotgun (blue). One shot at a time. Much more powerful, wider target range.

Heavy recoil.

Automatic machine gun (green). Multiple-shots of pistol-level damage.

Missile launcher (yellow). Shoots very damaging missiles. Large Recoil.

Added in Episode 2:

Dark Claw (black). Demon weapon that casts a dark cloud of tortured essence.

Silent but deadly.

Added in Episode 3:

Probiectile (orange). Minimal damage, but gives readout on enemy.

Added in Doom 4-6 are:

Spray rifle (brown). Multiple shots in a 600 are. Powerful as shotgun, but spread

out more. Shotgun recoil.

BFG 2704 (red). Horrible hallway-scouring weapon. Damages user a bit. Awful

recoil. BFG stands for "Big Fucking Gun." Safest use: back to wall, distant target.

In the commercial game, we have the final, rare weapon:

Unmaker (white). Demon-tech weapon that hurts pure demons a lot, demon-humans very

little, tech demons some. Made of demon bones.

Ammo is required for weapons, of course, so here it is!

possessed humans or hellslaves allows the weapons to feed.

1 4 .2 Us e f u l It e ms

There's a lot of useful stuff in Doom. For instance. we got yer healing:

Stim-Pack. Provides small boost to health -- it keeps you going until you can get real

help.

Medikit. Provides good bonus to health.

Soul sphere. Contains the life energy of a human soul (and thus, it is a 1-Up)!

Could become another shape if this seems too wolfish.

We got yer treasure:

Blood Receptacle. Gold bowl used in sacrifices.

Dagger  . Also used in sacrifices, this knife is black and red.

Chi Gem. Drops from true demons once they die, valuable item. Colors denote

aura magnitude (read, how many points you get).(Also, it's a pun-"Chi" is pronounced

"key.")

Unholy Bible. Found only in Hell, this is a tome of great evil and holds some

knowledge of the ways of demons (if studied for awhile-i.e. player doesn't have

time to use knowledge). Well-guarded.

And, o' course, we got yer powerups:

Detectors/Enhancers:

AutoMap. Maps the current area for you, retains map of where you've been.

Infrared Scanner. Allows you to see enemy through walls, in dark, invisible



<a name="br57"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

demons (in later episodes).

Sonar. Allows you to see all exits, obvious and secret.

Armor:

Duty armor: will take first ? health points away from damage to wearer.

Guard armor: will take first ? health points away from damage to wearer.

Battle Armor: will take first ? health points away from damage to wearer.

Demon armor: Will take all damage, but a bit of health leaves at every hit.

Energy fields  (very high damage can overload them):

Beam shield. Lessens effects of energy weapons.

Disruptor Shield. Eliminates effects of energy weapons, save for the BFG.

Deflector Shield. Deflects grenades and missiles.

Ban shield. Prevents all solid weapons from hitting.

Both armor and energy shields take damage when hit, until they are no longer

useful.

Other protections:

Shockshield. Acts like a deflector shield, but creatures you bump into suffer

electrical shock damage. The shield is temporary.

Shadow Cloak. This makes you temporarily invisible.

Chaos Field. Makes monsters nearby fight each other.

Episodes 2-6 and the commercial game will have items that fill out the story, and

give the game have a sense of richness.

For Immediate Release:

Id Software to Unleash *DOOM* on the PC

Revolutionary Programming and Advanced Design Make For Great Gameplay

DALLAS, Texas, December 1, 1992 -- Heralding another technical revolution in

PC programming, Id Software's *DOOM* promises to push back the boundaries of

what was thought possible on a 386sx or better computer. The company plans to

release *DOOM* in the third quarter of 1993, with versions for the PC in DOS,

Windows, Windows NT, and a version for the NeXT.

In *DOOM*, you play one of four off-duty soldiers suddenly thrown into the

middle of an interdimensional war! Stationed at a scientific research facility,

your days are filled with tedium and paperwork. Today is a bit different. Wave

after wave of demonic creatures are spreading through the base, killing or

possessing everyone in sight. As you stand knee-deep in the dead, your duty

seems clear-you must eradicate the enemy and find out where they're coming

from. When you find out the truth, your sense of reality may be shattered!

The first episode of *DOOM* will be shareware. When you register, you'll

receive the next two episodes, which feature a journey into another dimension,

filled to its hellish horizon with fire and flesh. Wage war against the infernal

onslaught with machine guns, missile launchers, and mysterious supernatural

weapons. Decide the fate of two universes as you battle to survive! Succeed and

you will be humanity's heroes; fail and you will spell its doom.

The game takes up to four players through a futuristic world, where they may

cooperate or compete to beat the invading creatures. It boasts a much more

active environment than Id's previous effort, *Wolfenstein 3-D*, while retaining the

pulse-pounding action and excitement. *DOOM* features a fantastic fully texture-

mapped environment, a host of technical tour de forces to surprise the eyes,

multiple player option, and smooth gameplay on any 386 or better.

John Carmack, Id's Technical Director, is very excited about *DOOM*: “*Wolfenstein*

is primitive compared to *DOOM*. We're doing *DOOM* the right way this time.

I've had some very good insights and optimizations that will make the *DOOM*

engine perform at a great frame rate. The game runs fine on a 386sx, and on a

486/33, we're talking 35 frames per second, fully texture-mapped at normal

detail, for a large area of the screen. That's the fastest texture-mapping around –

period.”

Texture mapping, for those not following the game magazines, is a technique

that allows the program to place fully-drawn art on the walls of a 3-D maze.

Combined with other techniques, texture mapping looked realistic enough in

*Wolfenstein 3-D* that people wrote Id complaining of motion sickness. In *DOOM*,

the environment is going to look even more realistic. Please make the necessary

preparations.

A Convenient *DOOM* Blurb

*DOOM* (Requires 386sx, VGA, 2 Meg)

Id Software's *DOOM* is real-time, three-dimensional, 256-color, fully texture-

mapped, multi-player battle from the safe shores of our universe into the

horrifying depths of the netherworld! Choose one of four characters and you're

off to war with hideous hellish hulks bent on chaos and death! See your friends

bite it! Cause your friends to bite it! Bite it yourself! And if you won't bite it,

there are plenty of demonic denizens to bite it for you!

*DOOM* -- where the sanest place is behind a trigger.

An Overview of DOOM Features

Texture-Mapped Environment

*DOOM* offers the most realistic environment to date on the PC. Texture-

mapping, the process of rendering fully-drawn art and scanned textures on the

walls, floors, and ceilings of an environment, makes the world much more real,

thus bringing the player more into the game experience. Others have attempted

this, but *DOOM's* texture mapping is fast, accurate, and seamless. Texture-

mapping the floors and ceilings is a big improvement over *Wolfenstein*. With

their new advanced graphic development techniques, allowing game art to be

generated five times faster, Id brings new meaning to "'state-of-the-art."

Non-Orthogonal Walls

*Wolfenstein's* walls were always at ninety degrees to each other, and were always

eight feet thick. *DOOM's* walls can be at any angle, and be of any thickness.

Walls can have see-through areas, change shape, and animate. This allows more

natural construction of levels. If you can draw it on paper, you can see it in the

game.

Light Diminishing/Light Sourcing

Another touch adding realism is light diminishing. With distance, your

surroundings become enshrouded in darkness. This makes areas seem huge and

intensifies the experience. Light sourcing allows lamps and lights to illuminate

hallways, explosions to light up areas, and strobe lights to briefly reveal things

near them. These two features will make the game frighteningly real.

Variable Height Floors and Ceilings

Floors and ceilings can be of any height, allowing for stairs, poles, altars, plus



<a name="br62"></a> 

DO O M Bibl e

S e c t io n 1 5

low hallways and high caves-allowing a great variety for rooms and halls.

Environment Animation and Morphing

Walls can move and transform in *DOOM*, which provides an active--and

sometimes actively hostile environment. Rooms can close in on you, ceilings

can plunge down to crush you, and so on. Nothing is for certain in *DOOM*.

To this Id has added the ability to have animated messages on the walls,

information terminals, access stations, and more. The environment can act on

you, and you can act on the environment. If you shoot the walls, they get

damaged, and stay damaged. Not only does this add realism, but provides a

crude method for marking your path, like violent bread crumbs.

Palette Translation

Each creature and wall has its own palette which is translated to the game's

palette. By changing palette colors, one can have monsters of many colors,

players with different weapons, animating lights, infrared sensors that show

monsters or hidden exits, and many other effects, like indicating monster

damage.

Multiple Players

Up to four players can play over a local network, or two players can play by

modem or serial link. You can see the other player in the environment, and in

certain situations you can switch to their view. This feature, added to the 3-D

realism, makes *DOOM* a very powerful cooperative game and its release a

landmark event in the software industry.

This is the first game to really exploit the power of LANs and modems t

otheir full potential. In 1993, we fully expect to be the number one cause of

decreased productivity in businesses around the world.

Smooth, Seamless Gameplay

The environment in *DOOM* is one big world. You enter and exit buildings, walk

around outside, explore underground, take something off a table, and so on. Just

like real life. Everything is actual size. You never have to leave the game

environment unless you quit or save your first game. And the frame rate (the

rate at which the screen is updated) is high, so you move smoothly from place to

place, turning and acting as you wish, unhampered by the slow jerky motion of

most 3-D games. On a 386sx, the game runs well, and on a 486/33, the normal

mode frame rate is faster than movies or television. This allows for the most

important aspect of gameplay-immersion.

Aardwolf. A maned striped mammal (Proteles cristatus) of southern and eastern

Africa that resembles the related hyenas and feeds chiefly on carrion and insects.

The aardwolf has sort of become the mascot of Id, appearing on Tom's Gotta

The Aardwolf

And. Logical operation that evaluates to true only if both operators are true. So if

Tom and John are in the office, it is true that no work gets done.

Blit. In general, stuff data somewhere, but usually means draw to screen. Often

implies as fast as possible. Usage: "'The calculations take little time compared to

blitting the whole game window."

Delce. Alfonso's utility to shab together and decompress a file that has been Ice-d

onto a bunch of disks. Written mostly in a night, with Tom breathing over John's

Perhaps the coolest install ever.

Hag Spot. Location of the oldest member of Id. Related to the "Tag Spot," the place

on a wall corner that Carmack's cat Mitzi suddenly runs at, rubs her declawed paws

on, then runs past. Also, the "Shag Spot" is where Adrian is.

lce. John Romero's dandy Installation Creation Editor. Allows anything that’s been

zip2exe-D (or whatever) to be chopped up onto separate disks, waiting longingly to

be reunited with its brethren.

The new version will use IdPack, and not require that silly Wisconsinite's

PkZipper.

IGrab. You grab, we all grab with IGrab. Seventeen projects later, IGrab lies with

four stakes and ten silver bullets in its heart. Used by shab companies.

Lumpy. At 2:03am,Oct20,l992,we were trying to think of a new name for SGrab,our Vga

graphic grabber. Romero said "Lumpy," and it was love.

Muse. Torture in the form of an executable. Oh, yeah, you can edit PC and AdLib

sounds in it. And import music. And see a digitized sound import that doesn't do

anything. And see funny blue lines march across your screen. And save out five

meg sound files. And have two red lines that show the end of the sound. And see a

red line and no sound, though you can play it. And have all the maximum values

suddenly disappear. All these features, and no damn cut and paste! For a fuckin'

year!!! (But i'm not bitter ... )

Patches. We don't need no stinking patches...

Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. The longest word in the English

ShowKill. Type "SK filename.LBM" to view LBMS. If you want to get that LBM off

your hard drive, press “D”.
