- Once upon a time...

  Once  upon  a  time,  there  was  a  lonesome  Recluse,  plagued with  the  desire  to  raise  a  child.  Wandering  nearby,  the strange  Witch  of  the  Woods  overheard  this  wish,  and  with a  twisted  humor  gifted  them  a  pot  of  dirt.  Help  guide  the Recluse  through  the  maze  of  fungal  parenthood,  then discover  how  many  types  of  person  (*mushroom?*)  your Daughter can become!

  When  one  Daughter  falls,  start  over  and  discover  new corners  of  the  world...  and  a  treasure  trove  of  secrets and unlockables!

- Raise a child, reap the rewards!

Raising  a  child  is  hard,  raising  a  mushroom  is  no  easier.  Any  little thing  you  do  can  change  your  Daughter's  path  in  life  -  will  she  grow into a pretty little Fly Agaric or an uncanny and indomitable Cordyceps?

A  parent's role is key, so take it  seriously... or perhaps you'd rather relax. There's always next time, after all!

- Unearth a vast fairytale world

The  world  of  Mushroom  Musume  is  fun  and  unusual,  full  of  whimsical moments  and  unexpected  dark  corners.  Discover  shocking  new outcomes and twists in familiar events by playing again as a different

Daughter. Choose alternate paths, and gain a more complete picture of this  odd  world.  Perhaps  even  spend  time  in  a  tale-within-a-tale  and see the world through (slightly less) fungal-colored glasses...

- Fill out a farmers almanac

You  can  find  almost  any  color  in  fungi,  and  that's  true  of  your Daughter  too.  Collect  memories  of  Daughters  past,  colors,  music,  and more  in  your  own  personal  Mushroom  Almanac.  With  tons  of  treats  to discover, foraging for everything could take years!

- Enjoy the sights and sounds! Mushroom Musume is filled with...![](Aspose.Words.854d3661-0d9b-405e-8ce8-90dd109d1a6b.003.png)
  - 180,000+ words of story
  - Hundreds of photographs and illustrations
    - Over two hours of beautiful and haunting music

...So  please,  take  a  seat  and  enjoy  your  time  spent  as  a  mycological parent!![](Aspose.Words.854d3661-0d9b-405e-8ce8-90dd109d1a6b.004.png)

*Note:  Mushroom  Musume  is  still  in  active  development!  While  we're  starting  to  get pretty close to our ideal of a stable, feature-rich, build, we're not quite there yet. As ![](Aspose.Words.854d3661-0d9b-405e-8ce8-90dd109d1a6b.005.png) such,  there  may  unfortunately  be  some  instability  of  save  files  between versions. This was originally a  game jam game, so a  lot  of work is  being put into making the code and systems at play more robust, so please bear with us~!*
