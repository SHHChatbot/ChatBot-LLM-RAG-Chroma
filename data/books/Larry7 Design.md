What has made the Larry games successful?

•  comedy; funny, outrageous, silly, slapstick, bawdy, titillating

•  Babes; saucy, sassy, sexy, but they usually come out "on top"

•  puzzles; fair but not difficult

•  appeal to males' prurient interest, sense of humor, and feelings of
superiority over Larry

•  appeal to women? They've all dated a jerk like Larry.

•  initial purchase may be for the babes, but people return for the
humor

What haven't the games been?

•  Pornographic.

•  Technological breakthroughs.

•  Large.

Topics to consider:

•  The marketplace is crowded. No room for another "okay" game. Needs
"wow!" factor. Needs new

> look.

•  women 25% of past sales; we'll lose them if there's too much video or
realistic women or graphic sex

•  it's a parody, not a simulation. Can we afford actresses with great
bodies who can also do comedy?

•  the writing, situations, characters have all been cartoony. Live
video must be handled differently.

•  there's no way to produce a GK2 or Phantas-style full-video game by
October

Therefore, Leisure Suit Larry 7 should:

•  be animated, but with more and better animation than any game done
yet

•  have a new background style of art mixing photos & paint & 3-D; not
photo-realism, but photo-

> surrealism

•  keep Larry himself animated, but with great animation and lots of
close-ups, reaction shots, etc.

•  keep the girls animated, but sexier, more detailed, better-animation
and much more action

Larry game with a cameo appearance by the gamer*\
We provide a template & tools; you see yourself in the game.

*first game with user-recorded dialogue*\
We provide a "suggested" script & instructions on how to record and save
your own .WAV files. (Of course, we'll provide default lines in case
they don't want to.)

*first graphic adventure with "Scratch & Sniff" puzzles*\
We include a CD-sized card in every game box with 9 different smells.
Some are used for puzzles, the rest just for laughs.

*typed input*\
We accept one-word "topics" of conversation and recognize at least
"some" of them.

*no more "walking around"*\
a map of the ship lets you move directly from location to location

*hotter sexual content*\
but the emphasis is still on humor, not porn.

*first game to update your Windows wallpaper as you progress*\
Every time you "finish" a women, your wallpaper changes to her picture.

multiple camera angles of each scene, more full-screen shots, more
cinematic "cuts" and "camera an-gles"

All characters have a greater variety of topics to discuss

*better-than-humanly-possible women*\
hand-drawn, cel-animated women (with better-than-humanly-possible
"features") and great animation

*"full frontal nudityÓ*\
of course, it's a fake "magic eye" screen that merely claims "full
frontal nudityÓ but no matter what you do, you can never make it focus
into anything

*full-screen format*\
no more letterbox, everything is full-screen

*invisible interface*\
left click to look, left click and hold and a Win95-like menu bar
appears with multiple, variable verbs

*first game to include a real condom in every box*\
Of course, it's Larry-sized (i.e., pencil diameter)

Leisure Suit Larry finds himself booked on the world's gaudiest cruise
ship, where he discovers (sur-prise!) a shipload of beautiful women, all
of them smarter, stronger, cooler, hipper, more interesting than he. But
the ship's real knock-out is Captain Thygh, who blatantly offers the
winner of her (admittedly arbitrary) "Thygh's Man Trophy" competition
the chance to spend the following week "on me," that is, as her
per-sonal guest. Larry (and the player) can only imagine what goes on
inside her cabin (because nothing is ever shown).

> Larry vows, "This time things will be different."
>
> And for once, he's right...but also wrong.

Right, because this time he actually has sex (or at least he thinks he
does). Wrong, because he's still the same goofy out-of-touch loser, with
heart of gold (and chains to match). Wrong, because he's still
humili-ated, put-down, discarded; still the butt of every joke. Wrong,
because he still thinks disco got a bum rap.

Each woman provides him with the means to win one of Thygh's contests,
thus enabling him to reach his ultimate goal: to sail off into the
sunset with the gorgeous Swedish skipper, Captain Thygh.

The WorldÕs Gaudiest Cruise Ship, the PMS Bouncy, with its gorgeous
captain. A cruise ship is a con-trollable, tight little world in which
to stage the women, excuses for lots of outdoor activities with women in
skimpy swimsuits, saunas, spas, relaxed atmosphere, etc.

By using a rendered map of the ship, "walking around" is minimized.
Simply swing the ship's model around and click on the deck where you
want to be. You then fly inside the ship via a short (2-second) movie
until that deck's floor plan appears. Click on a room on that floor plan
and we immediately "teleport" to that location and see Larry enter the
scene. Of course, additional hot spots and details appear on the maps as
you explore the ship and discover new areas.

The structure features the best parts of Larry6's game play with new
ideas:

Each woman on the ship is just a target for Larry's amorous intentions.
Often, he succeeds in getting them alone, but often not in the way he'd
like. Every time, he ends up naked, sneaking back to his cabin, holding
a tiny something from the babe's cabin in front and in back, sidling
through the ship. Every time, he

almost gets inside his cabin when a little old lady comes out of her
cabin across the hall and says something expressing her disgust at his
behavior.

*1. Captain Thygh*\
*2. Jamie Lee Coitus*\
*3. Annette Boning*\
*4. Dewmi Moore*\
*5. Drew Baringmore*\
*6. Victorian Principles*\
*7. Wydoncha & Nailmi Jugg*

!

All the contests are on-going. Larry may enter multiple times and keep
his best score, but will always lose. Only through clever manipulation
(AKA "cheating"), can he win. At the opening meeting, he receives a
scorecard listing the activities he must win. It becomes an Inventory
object. When you Look at it, we go to a separate screen with a detailed
layout of the requirements.

*1. Craps Tournament*\
*2. Best Dressed Hand*\
*3. Tail Deck Bowling*\
*4. Horseshoe Toss*\
*5. Gourmet Cook-Off*\
*6. Sexual Technique Simulator*

She continually hints at murder, mentioning many different ways to do
it, suggesting things, but never ex-plicitly asking. Of course, Larry
misses her drift entirely. However, players won't since sub-titles
reveal both An-nette's and Larry's true meaning. (Annette's is usually
the opposite of what she says; Larry's is always the same.)

Later in the game, you can return to Annette's cabin, but only to talk
at the front door. You think An-nette still wants out of her job. ("Is
everything still okay with the old man?") She thinks you're reneging and
want more.

Topics: weather (whether what?), life (how life is fleeting, fragile),
I'm sorry about the other night, do you often lose your patients? (lose
my patience?),

I always say, Life is what happens while you are making other plans.

> That was John Lennon. He said that.

> No, he was with The Beatles. Anyway...

If you give her the insurance policy, she says thanks.

Finally, after Captain Thygh gives you the game's ultimate challenge,
you again return to Annette's cabin and more sub-titles. Larry says
nothing alarming but she hears "blackmail" in every line. She gives you
owner-ship of Boning Shipping Lines "out of gratitude for helping me
earn my freedom."

Beautiful, young, intelligent, perpetually-naked aeronautical industry
leader biographer nudist, Drew spends the entire cruise lying naked near
the pool, wear-ing nothing but her laptop. She's completely comfort-able
with her body, her nudity, and her abilities. The twist? Larry actually
has to talk her into her clothes!

Beautiful, young, attractive, intelligent, perpetually-naked writer,
Drew is permanently planted beside the clothing-optional swimming pool.
She loves nudism so much she rids herself of all her clothing
immediately upon boarding the ship by making her cabin boy lock up her
suitcase for the duration of the trip. She eats, sleeps, suns, swims the
entire cruise, heavily slathering SPF-300 all over her naked body, with
only her laptop com-puter for protection. As you talk with her, the
screen slowly drifts downward, until she interrupts just before

Twenty years ago, Jamie Lee Coitus was a Bayonne prom queen beautiful
enough to become a Paris runway model. Now she's a leading haute couture
designer. She's still gorgeous and desirable...until you hear her voice:
she's an aggressive, forceful, successful East Coast businesswoman with
too much gold jewelry, not too bright, but able to work her way around
anything. She looks great, but sounds like a high-pitched Fran Dresher,
only more so!

Beautiful, slender, former leggy super-model, Jamie Lee Coitus is a
Paris haute couture fashion designer with "a sinus infection." She has
bottles and jars everywhere filled with white powder, all with innocuous
names like "flour," "baking soda," "sugar," "perfectly legal pow-der,"
etc. We never mention her habit, nor does she. She looks a lot like
Jamie Lee Curtis.

She's Swedish, blond, forceful, powerful, and de-manding. She expects
utmost discipline, instant response to her every order, and udder
loyalty. She never grants an audience to mere passengers, merely
glancing out her cabin door's porthole. However, she compensates by
filling the ship with cheesecake boudoir photos of her-self.

Since the entire game revolves around the "Thygh's Man Trophy" plot
device, when Larry is finally declared the winner, you think the game is
over. But, after report-ing to Thygh's cabin, you discover there's yet
another twist. After seeing Larry, Captain Thygh demands more.

Talking to her reveals her secret desire is to return to her old
occupation: supertanker pilot! Fortunately you've done a favor for
someone who can now help you. Return to Annette Boning's cabin to
"discuss our little problem." Annette trades you the life insurance
policy you found for stock ownership of the crude oil shipping company
she just inherited, instantly turning you into "Larry Laffer, shipping
magnate!"

You return to Thygh's suite to offer her "a position working closely
under me!" As we cut to a shot of the PMS Bouncy bouncing its way into
the sunset, we hear her order, "Toss me those handcuffs, will ya,
Larry?"

> *Deep Swedish accent, barks orders, militaristic, her sadomasochism
> only slightly submerged.*

Peggy is the peg-legged fowl-mouthed deckhand. She's a stereotypical
pirate movie's nasty old salt, a swashbuckler with a surly attitude,
foul mouth, except she's not a he. She even has a peg leg, but hers
comes complete with interchangeable janitorial attachments. When you
first meet her, she's wearing the peg; it makes a conspicuous noise as
she walks on the wooden deck. But after that, every time you encounter
her, she has a different Rube Goldberg cleaning apparatus installed on
her peg, beginning with a mop, then a sweep broom, followed by a push

Straight from the demo. Larry carries the Sierra logo on his back.
Following this, fade to black. No title screen or theme song...yet. Go
directly to 101 La Costa Lotta \[below\]. Menu bars become active
immediately.

%%\$!

We begin in darkness, hearing only Larry's voice, happily moaning in
ecstasy. "Baby, you're the greatest! This is the happiest moment of my
life!" Shamara says, "I need more, Larry; something new. Here, slip into
these." We hear handcuffs clack closed. She turns on a light.

We see Larry standing on Shamara's bed at La Costa Lotta, his arms
spread far and high, his wrists handcuffed to the very high bedposts,
wearing only his jockeys. Shamara stands beside the bed, lighting a
cigarette. "God, Shamara, is there anything we haven't done?" "There's
lots I haven't done, Laffer. That's why I'm leaving." "Leav-ing? Now?
But..."

She takes his wallet from his pants. "Hey!" "Don't leave me here like
this!" "You're right," she says, and sticks her cigarette in his mouth.
He coughs, "Hey, come back! I don't smoke!" She exits, leaving Larry
dan-gling...literally. "At least things couldn't get worse!" as he
coughs more violently, dropping the cigarette onto the bed, which
immediately catches fire. "Oops." Soon flames are lapping at his feet.
"Ouch. Ow!"

This is the game's Larry5-style interface instructional scene, where we
give the player a few simple puzzles to make sure he understands the
interface and game play before starting the game. If he doesn't react
reasonably quickly, the narrator (or in this case, the fire chief)
instructs him how to use the interface.

Searching the room for hot spots, the player finds one on each of the
two night stands on either side of the bed: a pair of Vice Grips ("It's
good thing Shamara needed those Vice Grips last night!") and your
complimentary Hotel Hair Weave Kit. You can pluck a needle from the kit
with your toes. If you use it on the handcuffs, nothing happens because
the needle is still straight. You can not bend it in Inventory. But if
you use the Vice Grips on the needle in Inventory, you bend it into a
lock pick. A close-up looks shows a beautiful rake pick.

You can then pick the lock to escape the burning bed just as the flames
leap up and over the headboard. We hear sirens in the distance. You exit
here to get away from the flames and move into 120. Shamara's Front
Room.

> Here's how the hint system works:\
> •  there is a ordered list of actions a player must perform (the order
> is set outside the message file) •  when the opening handsOff scene
> ends and the player gets control, start a timer running\
> •  when the timer expires, find the next unperformed action in the
> action list and play its hint • \
> restart the timer every time a hint is played or the player performs
> an action on the action list •  if an action has more than one hint,
> repeat the sequence's final message until the action is performed

We can see through the patio doors to the balcony outside. There is a
sturdy-looking hotel chair here. The way back to the bedroom is blocked
by flames. Click on the obvious exit feature and it bursts into flame.
"The balcony!" you cry. You click on the balcony's glass patio door to
get a verb list, choose Open, and we see you try, but the han-dle is too
hot to hold. ("Our passionate love-making must have overheated this
handle!") There's a hot spot on the chair. Click on the chair to get a
verb list, select "Throw," and we see you throw it at the glass patio
door. The door doesn't budge, but the chair shatters into tiny
splinters. ("Hotel furniture must not be as good as it looks!") There's
a floor lamp made from barbells that seems the obvious thing to throw
through glass doors. But it's too heavy for you to lift. "Why, that must
weigh 30 pounds!"

You hear the fire chief's bullhorn from outside say, "Jump. Jump!" After
20 seconds the bullhorn bellows, "Break the window!" After another 20
seconds he shouts, "For God sakes, man; you're not limited to the

another 20 seconds he cries, "Click on the door and hold! Scroll down
the resulting menu to 'Other...' type in the word 'Break!'"

...a low right angle to the patio doors as Larry throws himself through
the plate glass door, shattering it. He tumbles forward, his bare back
rolling across the shards of broken glass a la Die Hard, turning his
back into a bloody mess. He ends up on his knees, where we cut to...

;\<\</##\* /B/\
We cut to a POV over Larry's shoulder looking down past his bloody back
riddled with shards of glass. We see him spy a paper folder. He reaches
for it, and cries out in pain! "I HATE paper cuts!" He quickly stuffs
the folder into his underwear as we cut back to...

;\<=/!

We look down on Larry from above, seeing the fire trucks, firemen, and
landing pad far, far below. The bullhorn orders, "Jump!" You click on
Larry and the almost only verb is "Jump." So you do. We see Larry back
up and start to run for the railing when we cut to...

;\<\>/,\'\
This angle shows the balcony from below as Larry throws himself over the
railing and off the side in slow mo-tion, a la Die Hard.

;\<?/2\*//\
We see the firemen with the safety net. There are several awnings and
patios visible above and off to the side of the net. No, he doesn't miss
the net, he bounces off it, slamming into a balcony ceiling above
("Ow!"), then hits the flag pole ("Doh!"), then a patio ceiling
("Yow!"), breasts, diving board, etc. moving left and out of the frame
as the Homer Simpson sfx follow, then cut to...

;\<@/ /B/\
...a close-up of Larry lying spread eagle in cactus. Harsh
camera-mounted video camera lights illuminate his face. The lower part
of the screen carries a typical CNN graphic with "Larry Laffer," the
horizontal red line, the CNN logo on the right (except make it U&C), and
below Larry's name, "Lucky bastard." Larry glances down nerv-ously at
his underpants, digs inside them, removing the giant bulge, and looks at
the cruise ship ticket. A microphone protrudes into the frame and a
voice-over news-type says, "Leisure Suit Larry, you just jumped from the
40th floor of a burning building! Now what are you going to do?" Larry
looks up, says, "I'm goin' to..." pushes the ticket to the camera
filling the frame before finishing with, "...take a cruise!" (Boat
whistle!)

,!

;=A///\
The ticket shows Shamara's name in the corner and a color picture of a
ship in the middle. The ship picture on the ticket turns into a real
ship, just pulling away from the dock under steam, segueing us to...

As the throbbing ship steams past the camera.

Each team member gets an individual creative title that best fits his
contribution while various vignettes of cruise ship stuff goes by:
luggage, gangplanks, leis, confetti, smoke from the stack, sails
unfurling, flags in the wind, look-ing out the bridge windshield,
looking down on the ship with its wake trailing behind, dice rolling
across a craps ta-ble, sails unfurling, paddles rowing, hamsters running
in little wheels, etc.

A L. S. of the PMS Bouncy bouncing its way into the distant sunset, we
hear Captain Thygh order, "Toss me those handcuffs, will ya, Larry?" The
ship shrinks away into the sunset as the credits appear and we cycle
through the best music from the game.

A extreme long shot showing nearly the entire ship, with a tiny Larry
climbing a mast. You must get here from 211. Bridge Exterior, below.
Turn down the volume on the PA announcements and the music, so it feels
like we\'re a long way above the ship. Turn up the wind noise. There are
two exit features: one leads back to 211. Bridge Exterior, the other
leads up to...

\<A;/C\*!

A normal, 100% Larry walker scene, beginning with Larry still on the
mast's ladder and the sails furled. When you click anywhere on the
yardarm, Larry leaves the ladder and moves onto the furled sail, its
rolled-up fabric wrapped tightly around the yardarm like a window shade
on a giant roller. A Look reveals, "They're made from white polyester,
just like your Leisure Suit, Larry." ("Leisure Suit Larry? Hey, that's
me!")

Turn down the volume on the PA announcements and the music, so it feels
like we\'re a long way above the ship. Turn up the wind noise. If you
haven't futzed with the PA system/sail junction box, nothing much
happens here. You can go out on the yardarm and back, but accomplish
nothing.

But the paragraphs below assume you have (futzed, that is). There are no
random PA announcements here. In-stead, this scene controls the PA
announcements.

If you go out on the yardarm before the sails unfurl, a quick PA
announcement unrolls the fabric, causing Larry to act like a drunk
lumberjack in a log rolling contest. He quickly loses his balance and
falls off. We cut to 210.

Bridge Exterior below where you're none the worse for wear, but of
course you have to re-climb the mast.

But, if instead, you wait a random few seconds for a PA announcement,
the motorized yardarm conveniently un-furls the fabric for you. You may
then walk out on the yardarm safely. There are no further announcements
until you either use the knife on the sails or exit the yardarm.

Once you're on the yardarm, if you use the knife on the sail, we see
Larry slice off yards of fabric, gathering it up as he crosses the
screen, going completely off the right side of the screen, although the
sounds of knife cutting cloth continue until a second PA announcement
causes the sails to quickly wrap back up again. We pan right, out the
yardarm to...

\<A\</()\*B\
Larry is trapped inside the rolled-up sail like a pig in a snake. "Oh,
no!" "This will be the last announcement of the evening. Good Night!"
Larry spouts a muffled, "Doh!" from within the cloth. We fade to black,
then fade in on...

A beautiful sunrise showing Larry still bundled inside the sail. Same
camera angle, shot, pose, everything, ex-cept the background is now
morning, looking East. We hear William Tell's dawn breaking music, a
cock crows, and the PA announcer shouts, "Good Morning, lil' cruise
buddies..." (Larry: "Uh, oh."), pause a beat, then the sail quickly
unfurls, tumbling Larry out of the frame and off-screen. We cut to 210.
Bridge Exterior below where you follow the same routine as falling off
from 201. The Yardarm above.

This is a L. S. showing just a tiny part of the sails flying overhead.
There's a ladder leading up to the mast, an open doorway labeled
"Bridge," plus an electrical junction box here.

If the previous room was 201. The Yardarm above, we begin this scene
with you splatted on the deck. You get up, brush off your leisure suit,
and return to your normal stop-walker as if nothing happened.

Captain Thygh never actually hangs out here. Instead, she has people who
do this stuff for her! You can see in-side, but you can't enter. There
is a control just inside the doorway, within easy reach, labeled
"Sails." An obvious conduit leads from the switch to the outside (where
you stand).

> When you exit here, you return to the Bridge Exterior, above.

\<;\</3D /B/\
This shows just the interior of the Fuse Box. Two simple fuses, nearly
filling the screen, run horizontally, la-beled "PA System" and "Sails."
If you Use the jumper wire from the employees' break room to connect the
two fuses together, you get some points, but nothing obvious happens.
However, from now on, whenever you hear a PA announcement anywhere, you
hear the sails' motor noise softly in the background.

\$)\'\
This room is just aft of 210. The Bridge Exterior. Thygh's cabin door is
here. Beside it is the left edge of a whiteboard with some Greeked
writing representing the names of the contestants. If you Look at the
whiteboard, we cut to 221. Scoreboard C. U. below.

Captain Thygh spends the entire week "behind closed doors," practicing
her own unique form of "hands on management." If you Knock on her door,
after a few moments, her hand appears behind the porthole wiping the
steam off the inside of the glass. Her head then appears. This is as
much of a C. U. as you get until you get inside this door.

> When she's not visible in the porthole, we hear the soft moans of the
> previous winner in the background.

After hearing the PA announce you as this week's "Thygh's Man Trophy"
contest winner, when you Knock, you hear, "It's open" and you go inside.
We cut to 222. Thygh's Interior below.

\<\<;/\* /B/\
This is a C. U. of the whiteboard beside Thygh's door, displaying the
current standings in the "Thygh's Man Trophy" contest. On it, we display
the relative progress of each contestant (each of whom is named after a
Team Larry member). Let's make the names by literally writing with a
felt pen on paper, then scanning it in. A bar graph beside each name
shows his or her current status.

The only programming here concerns the player's progress through the
game. At first, it's obvious from the rela-tive rankings that Larry's
losing, but later on, as you complete more and more puzzles, you pull
ahead. After the PA announcement to report to Captain Thygh's suite, all
the names are erased, with just Larry's name and perfect score
remaining.

\<\<\</6\
Her cabin's interior, that is. When at last, you've finally completed
(that is, "cheated on") every single contest, a PA announcement summons
you to Thygh's cabin. You knock on the door and hear her order you in,
which you obey.

She takes one long look at you and reacts like Jon Lovitz, "Why,
no...that wasn't part of the offer." "Sure, you've won the week-long
complimentary cruise." "Yeah, I know I said the winner would get to
spend a week with me...but I'm filled with ennui." "Aw, hell! It's gonna
take a lot more than just a mere contest to get me to sleep with you!"\
en·nui (òn-wê¹, òn¹wê) noun Listlessness and dissatisfaction resulting
from lack of interest; boredom: "The servants relieved their ennui with
gambling and gossip about their masters" (John Barth). French, from Old
French enui, from ennuier, to annoy, bore, from Vulgar Latin.

Talk to her and learn her secret desire is to return to her old
occupation as "first mate" on the Boning Valdez su-pertanker. "I just
can't understand why I lost my assistant supertanker pilot's job...just
'cause we ran aground. Like it's my fault Captain Hazelton would rather
spend the night in my cabin instead of on that drafty old bridge!" "I'd
do anything to 'steam with some real mass' under me again!"

If you Use the stock certificate on Thygh, you tell her about your new
position with Boning Shipping, and offer her a "new position" with the
company too. You offer Thygh "a lifelong position working closely under
me!" Cut to the Epilogue, 150. Bouncing Into The Sunset above.

This exterior is just aft of 260. Promenade Deck, below, and shows the
Lounge entrance. It looks similar to 133. "Welcome Aboard, Laffer"
above, but is a walker scene. The first time you enter, the CyberSniff
2000 logo flashes the "ocean breezes" smell, smell #1.

This scene is truly multi-purpose: there are 5 different conditions
which affect the graphics displayed as well as game play:

The Stage must be low enough for Larry to hop right up from the floor;
no stairs, back entrances, etc. There are guitar amplifiers and speaker
cabinets on stage but no drum set since the Juggs use a karaoke
background for their vocals (damn 'em!). The bar is near the door to the
Juggs' dressing room. A soundboard is barely visible at stage right but
inaccessible until you are allowed on stage.

You can Talk to Johnson, the bartender. If you type in "Lime Juice,"
Larry and he replay Jack Nicholson's Five Easy Pieces bit "just to get
some lousy lime juice." Johnson needs a C. U., and we'll reuse other
Larry C. U.'s from elsewhere in the game.

You can type in other drink names; Johnson will respond to as many as we
can recognize. We then cut back to the L. S. and see Johnson whip
something up nearly instantaneously and slap it on the bar. He
volunteers to just "charge it to your room." Larry takes the drink from
the bar, slams it back, and never gets drunk. ("Boy are these drinks
watered down!")

*Pre-Juggs*\
The door to the Juggs' dressing room is somewhere near the bar. It's
never locked nor occupied (well, for an Easter egg it's occupied, but
more on that below). Whenever you try to enter, Johnson notices you and
orders you to halt, which you do. But, if you Talk to Johnson and type
in "gigantic erection," he warns you that "a drink like that takes a
long time to prepare. You'll have to give me a while." Then, he turns
his back on you and commences some sort of busy loop facing away from
Larry and the dressing room door. While he's mixing (30" perhaps?), you
can enter the Juggs dressing room. Go to 245. Juggs' Dressing Room
below. After 30 seconds, if you're still here, he serves you, you drink
it, ("Doesn't seem to work for me.") and once again you can't sneak into
the dressing room.

When you return here from the dressing room (no matter how long you
spend), Johnson is still working on your drink. But when you get near
the bar (as the entrance script ends?), he turns around, announces he
has just completed your "gigantic erection," and serves it to you
proudly. You behave exactly as with all the other drinks above.

Any time you have the heat lamp, you can use it on the pin spot here.
This time, we see Larry reach up, futz with the lighting instrument,
open and close it.

> You can not go on stage ('cause there's no feature there!).

*Post-Juggs*\
Following the Juggs encounter, the stage is obviously a mess. The stage
now has an exit feature. Click it to go to 243. Lounge Stage M. S., see
below. You can't see much or take anything from the stage in this view.

> The earplugs are backstage here, near the sound mixing board.

\<\>;/\
This is the same pic as in 240. The Lounge above, except the pic isn't
empty, but filled with men (and a few suspiciously masculine women).
Coincidentally, just as you enter, the Purser starts his meeting
explaining the "Thygh's Man Trophy" competition. You wait near the door.
We need a Purser C. U., but can re-use the Larry C. U.'s for his
reactions.

"\...be seated and we\'ll get started. There are still a few chairs
there in the back. Oh, never mind. If you\'re not seated by now, just
remain standing! (BEGIN) I\'m sure Captain Thygh will be pleased to see
such a good turnout this week. As I\'m sure you know, each week the good
Captain runs a little competition for her male (SOTTO VOCE) (or
male-like) (NORMAL) passengers, which I tend to call \"The Thygh\'s Man

you win is better than hardware: one lucky man will spend all next week
\"Cruising on the Captain.\" (CLEAR THROAT) That is, she treats you to a
one-week cruise in her cabin, with her, where your (A LITTLE DISGUST)

listing the events the computer assigned to you. Enter each event at
your leisure and the "man" with the highest cu-mulative score will win.
Are there any questions?"

At the end, the Purser asks "Are there any questions?" To which the
crowd responds in unison, "Are there any answers?" Purser: "You may
begin." During a Larry C. U., we hear the other audience members scurry
out while Larry asks, "What this item listed here: chastity?" "It's a
joke, pal! Waddaya a government infiltrator?" Then, in-stead of
returning to the 241 L. S., we go to 240. The Lounge above under player
control. Everyone, including the purser, has left, leaving you alone to
talk to Johnson and explore.

\<\>\</\'!E\
This is a 30-second, handsOff cartoon showing the Juggs on-stage,
performing their lil' ol' country hearts out, (i.e., we hear the last
four bars of some bad tune). Their clothes are lit and flashing gaudily.
As the applause starts, Larry walks across the room heading for the only
empty chair. He passes the front center of the stage just as the
ap-plause ends and Wydoncha says, "Now we need a volunteer for the
'Unplugged' part of our set. Who wants to play with our jugs?" Larry
leaps for the stage, hands outstretched in the universal "feel"
position.

*Juggs + Larry MS*\
"Why, here's one," Nailmi says, "Howdy, buckaroo!" slapping down his
hands (at the italics). Wydoncha: "Par-don us, while we whip these
out..." Audience: "(gasp!)" We see both women pull moonshine jugs out of
their blouses and hand them to Larry as Nailmi yells, "Hey, Johnson? How
'bout some special lighting?" Cut to black screen, the music begins,
then...

*Spotlight C. U.*

> We see your "specially configured" spotlight turn on.

*Red Lit Juggs + Larry M. S.*

Larry cradles a jug in each arm, waits a couple bars, then alternately
blows into each jug. The girls wait to sing while the music vamps.

*Spotlight C. U.*

> We see the spotlight overheat as the music continues.

*Nailmi C. U.*

> Nailmi: "Whew, is it hot in here!"

*Wydoncha C. U.*

> "Oh, Mom. I'm gettin' that feeling again!"

*Larry With 6 Jugs C. U.*

> Larry does an eye take, first left, then right, then straight at
> camera, then cracks a big, lucky grin.

*Red Lit Juggs + Larry M. S., lower camera angle*\
During the cut back to this shot, we hear both girls shout, "Get him!"
They grab Larry, throw him down beside the amplifier stacks while their
karaoke background track continues without them, in full view of the
audience, al-though not the player. We see white polyester clothes fly.
The crowd cheers. Electrical flashes and sparks fly. The crowd yee-haws.
We cut to a black pic, lit only by the continuing sparks. Electrically
flashing clothes fly. The crowd goes, "Oooh." Strobe light tableaux
ensue. The crowd goes, "Aah." The sexual moaning, music and crowd noises
all fade together to silence and total blackness. We then fade back in
on the hallway outside Larry's room, where we see him cowering behind a
large Country Music Awards Show belt buckle.

The Juggs leave their battery-powered chase light wardrobe lying all
over the stage (turned off), and its remote control lying by the
soundboard.

\<\>=///\
After the Juggs cartoon, an exit feature appears on the stage in 240.
The Lounge which brings you to this M. S. The camera angle is from the
POV of the sound engineer, i.e., the soundboard looms large in the near
foreground

making the remote control lying beside it easier to find. The clothing
with the chase lights lies clearly visible, scat-tered around the stage.

You can walk into the foreground and Take the remote control. You can
Take the chase lights by clicking on the clothing. The clothing remains
visible, but without the lights.

There are some ear plugs lying hidden behind the soundboard which you
can't see. You must Type in "Look Behind" the soundboard to find them.

\<\>\>/ !\*\
Once you've taken the battery-powered chase lights and the remote
control, the Lounge becomes a Comedy Club for the rest of the game. On
stage is Willy, an audioanimatronic karaoke stand-up comedian, hosting
"Great Moments With Mr. Clinton." He looks exactly like President
Clinton. The premise is: the audience records jokes, with the automaton
then plays back, with typical (albeit mechanical) stand-up gestures.

The audience fills every chair but one (conveniently the same one as
during the Juggs show). Whether you sit or stand, you get to hear jokes
picked at random from WAV files in a special sub-directory. (Larry Scott
alert!) We'll ship a Bill Clinton impersonator telling a bunch of jokes,
but you'll be able to upload your own jokes in the form of WAV files
and/or download joke WAV files from our Web site. Put the files in the
correct sub-directory, and you get to hear new jokes every time!

> You may still need the Lime Juice, so Johnson still works the bar.

Their unglamorous dressing room that looks like a reject from the
country-western roadhouse, with country crap everywhere. A shelf along
one wall serves as their make-up table and a clothes rack made from pipe
hanging on wires from the ceiling. A can of spray deodorant sits near
the make-up mirror, which has the typical bare bulbs all around it. They
have a mechanical bull and an 8-track player with a rack of karaoke
tapes of their songs, including: •  Big Hair An' Tangled Limbs\
Just A Cheap Pickup In A Cheap Pickup • \
•  Thinking With My Panties Again\
•  You Got Into My Bra (But Not Into My Heart)\
•  Get Along, Long John\
White Trash Or No Trash • \

•  Glove Compartment Panties\
It Takes More Than Cognitive Reasoning • \
•  Thinking Ain't Your Strong Suit\
•  He's Got His Daddy's Eyes (And His Other Daddy's Smile)

The Juggs' CD player is the game's juke box, i.e., a list of all the
music in the game so the player can listen to any music whenever he
wants just by coming here.

You can take their can of spray deodorant from their dressing table. You
can leave the silicone lubricant from the engine room on their dressing
table in exactly the same spot.

For an Easter egg, if you TBA, you can enter this room and catch just a
brief glimpse of the Juggs totally naked applying hair spray from a
Wagner power painter.

This area is adjacent to the Promenade Deck. It has several deck chairs,
all of which are always empty. The scoring machine here looks like a
centaur, with the horse's ass made of fiberglass while the man's torso
and head are made of topiary. It works like the others, but with a
perverse twist: when you Use the "Thygh's Man Trophy" score-card on the
machine we see Larry lift the horse's tail and insert the card into its
ass. The CyberSniff 2000 logo starts flashing the "fart" smell, smell
#5. The "horse" raises a mechanical rear leg. You must then Take the
horse-shoe. It enters Inventory. If you try to exit the area while the
horseshoe is in Inventory, we hear that airport voice-over announcer's
voice say, "Horseshoes may not be removed from the horseshoe area."

A Look at the iron horseshoe stake driven through the deck gives you a
clue. Another clue is the Map screen layout: the horseshoe area is
directly above the casino lobby. And climbing the scaffold is a dead
give-away, as the stake is right there by your head.

When you finally click on the lane and select Toss, or Use the
Horseshoe, we cut to 251. Horseshoe Stake C. U. below. You either hit or
miss the stake, but either way, when you return here, you hear your
score reported by a syn-thesized voice inside the horse's asshole. You
cannot leave without taking your card. When you do, Larry raises the
horse's tail and shoves his whole arm up the horse's ass. The horse
whinnies gratefully.

If you've wired the bottom of the horseshoe stake and press the remote
control within 20 seconds (or whatever we determine the "universal"
remote control's off-timer to be) before you Use the card on the
machine, when you get to 251. Horseshoe Stake C. U. below, you get the
winning cartoon.

\<?;/5\" /B/\
This quick cut scene shows the results of the toss you started above. In
the foreground we see the horseshoe stake in all its phallic glory, in
the far distance is a tiny Larry, and in the lower right corner of the
screen the flashing "StakeCam 2000" logo. We see Larry wind up and throw
the 'shoe toward the camera.

If you didn't cheat, the 'shoe goes far astray, completely off-screen,
and we hear an off-screen splash. The stake remains empty. We
immediately cut back to 250. Horseshoe Competition Area above.

But if you did cheat, we see you throw first one ringer, then another
and another. In the process, you create a weird, abstract, and obscene
sculpture of horseshoes and stake. Each additional throw takes slightly
less time, for an accelerando of horseshoes. We then cut back to 250.
Horseshoe Competition Area above.

The rear of the Promenade Deck. Deck chairs. The Juggs. Look over the
rear deck to see the rear-deck bowling, below. Not much more.

The Juggs hang out here at the beginning of the game. If you Talk to
them, we go to 256. Juggs C. U. below. They remain here until you've
finished "preparing their dressing room" for them (i.e., until you've
replaced their deodorant with the silicone lubricant). After that,
they're never seen here again.

\<?@/, /B/\
They're wearing grotesque country western swimsuits, spike heels,
microphones, and lots of hair spray. You can Talk to them about their
show. You learn they're going to begin performing tonight in the Lounge.
There are intima-tions of trouble with hair spray, Latex, spandex, heat.
They recognize and accept, but refuse to answer, questions about the
Persons Magazine article.

The Promenade Deck connects the Fo\'c\'s\'le, the Boarding Deck and the
Horseshoe Competition area, forming the middle of a long (non-scrolling)
set of pix. Peggy hangs out somewhere in these four pictures.

There is an unlocked fire hose storage cabinet on the wall here. You can
open the cabinet. You can Take the fire hose.

Peggy hangs out in either the Fo\'c\'s\'le, Boarding Deck, Promenade
Deck or Horseshoe Competition area. If you Talk to her in any of those
places, we come to this M. S. showing Peggy cut off at the waist (so we
don't need shots of all her miscellaneous attachments).

> "This god damn salt air is rusting my f\-\--king leg sockets!"

If you type in "cabin boy," Peggy tells you about Xqwzts's hidden room
behind the locker bay in the employees' break room.

> If you type in "locker number," she tells you which locker to open to
> find Xqwzts.
>
> If you type in "combination," she tells you the combination to open
> Xqwzts's locker.

If you type in "Xqwzts," she tells you Xqwzts wants into the US but he
has no passport. "Cheap f\-\--king bastard wants in so he can take away
jobs from us Americans?" "When's the last time you were in America,
Peggy?" "19 f\-\--king 73, d\-\--head! Who asked ya?"

You can type in "leg," she tells you how she lost her leg in a freak
accident: by inadvertently combining KZ Jelly with deodorant spray,
forming a powerful contact explosive. "Deodorant spray? Near your leg?"
"Let's just say I wasn't sprayin' it on my f\-\--king arm pits, okay

\[forecastle (fok¹sel, fôr¹kàs´el, for¹-) also fo\'c\'s\'le (fok¹sel)
noun. Nautical. 1. The section of the upper deck of a ship located at
the bow forward of the foremast.\]\
A L. S. forward of the Promenade Deck, featuring Ken, the
balloon-animal-making deckhand. It lets us see more of the ship,
confirming where you are above decks. Nothing but an exit feature to
walk back out. Also gives us a chance to say "fox-sell."

> There is a kumquat tree here. You can get kumquats from the tree.

If Peggy isn't here, Ken could be. If you Talk to him, he offers to make
you a "balloon animal." He goes through a loop of inflating the balloon
and shaping it. But every time, his "animal" looks like a penis. He
chooses one of three loops to "explain" which animal it is. The three
loops are "bird attacking from above," "bunny rabbit hopping along
medium," and "crocodile attacking from below." Each of those three loops
has about five random lines of ex-planation, i.e., "It's a pterodactyl!"
"It's a bald eagle!" "It's Hootie the owl!" etc.

If Ken isn't here, Peggy could be. If you Talk to her, we go to the same
old C. U. as always. She can also be anywhere along this deck: the
Boarding Deck, the horseshoes area, the Promenade, the Poop Deck, etc..

Larry can walk to the far rail and Look over to the Nude Sports Deck
below his feet. If we have time in August, we'll show a rather blank
playing field with naked people doing weird things. If not (and for
now), we'll at least hear the narrator say, "Nude Volleyball," "Nude
Roller Derby," "Nude Lawn Darts," "Nude Curling," "Nude Caber Toss-ing,"
"Nude Ferret Legging," and "Nude Gerbil Colonics."

To enter this scene you must go through 301. Changing Cabana below. When
you emerge from the cabana, you enter this pic, a longer shot showing
much of the pool, with many naked bodies on the other side, not much on
this side, and Drew Baringmore at the left edge of the scene,
strategically covered by palm fronds. This entire area is filled with
gratuitous T&A, although cleverly placed branches, waiters' trays,
balloons, etc. block total frontal nu-dity. The horizon is below the bow
of the ship, so we don't have to update the entire screen to make the
ship move up and down.

Larry needs 2 special walkers for this scene as he must be wearing the
CodMaster 2000 to be here. Since he can only walk on the near side of
the pool, a one-loop mirrored view will suffice for the walker. However,
the first time here, we use a special loop beginning about halfway
across the pic. The CodMaster 2000 looks like a miniature ele-phant's
face on a G-string; the dumber, the better.

The first time here, we prevent the player from knowing about the suit
by another special "sneaking around/looking around" handsOff sideways
walker that shows Larry from the front, holding his towel in front of
his groin. The implication must be his swimsuit is so small, he's
exposed. When Larry gets close to Drew, he finally turns to see her
rubbing her naked body with sunscreen. The first time you see this, the
CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "coconut" smell, smell #2.

He's so stunned ("Omigawd! Look at that!") he drops the towel, it hangs
in front of him as if on a towel rack. He then turns toward Drew,
displaying the towel hanging on his "rack." At the same time, she needs
to wipe off the sun-screen on her hands. She cries, "Oh, boy. Towel,
please!" reaches out, feels your towel, and whips it away, exposing not
Larry's giant erection, but a weird swimsuit that looks like a miniature
elephant's face on a G-string. Always the young historian, Drew comments
on your selection of the built-in codpiece. We then cut to 302. Drew
Baringmore M. S. below.

A copy of Persons magazine lies here on a table. You can Read it, but
not Take it. ("Once you read it, you no longer want to take it!") A Read
command tells you about the Juggs' unfortunate incident at the women's
prison gig last year.

> There's not much else to do. Any time you walk near Drew, we go to
> 302. Drew Baringmore M. S. below.

When you come back from 302. Drew Baringmore M. S. after telling her you
found her suitcase, you are both standing near her chaise, facing the
cabana. You walk together under handsOff to the cabana, with Larry
carefully staying between Drew's naked body and the camera.

> You don't want to enter the pool, as "you're afraid of shrinkage."

You can order a drink yourself from the off-screen waiter (even if Drew
is in your shower). You order "what the lady ordered...a gigantic
orgasm." Which prompts the response, "Oh, that'll take a while." Of
course the waiter never brings it to you.

=A;/\
The only entrance to 300. Swimming Pool is a small, covered, shaded
tunnel of latticework (Wood slats? Vines? Flowering vines? Potted palms?
Hanging clothing?) that reveals almost nothing. It's completely open at
top and bot-tom so we can just see the top of Larry's head and his feet
(or whatever angle is funniest). We can see partially into one end or
through a side, just enough so we can tell it's lined with hooks that
hold people's clothing. Everyone changes in here on their way into the
pool. The walls need to be just solid enough we can't see enough of
Dick, the pool attendant's face to require a talker, we can't see
exactly what Larry's wearing until he walks out, and we can't see much
of Drew when she walks through.

Dick, the surfer pool attendant, stands guard, preventing guests from
wearing clothing into the pool area for "safety reasons." ("That fabric
could ignite in this tropical sun!") Stage the walls so we never see his
face. Then no talker will be necessary either. He forces you to either
enter the pool area naked or change into a swimsuit. "I don't think I
should enter naked; everyone would be in awe of my physical attributes!"
"Yeah, they would stare, that's fer sure!" But, like restaurants that
require a tie, he can provide you with a "courtesy loaner. I'd say this
suit here is ex-actly what you need!" "But, it's so, so..." you protest,
ineffectually. "Yes, it is. But, it's the largest I've got!" "But isn't
it..." We see Larry exit the opposite end carefully holding a towel
hiding his swimsuit region, the implication being the loaner is
minuscule.

Every time you enter or leave the pool, Dick has an insult for you
(well, at least five) as he issues or takes back your "special suit."

When you enter this scene with Drew's luggage in Inventory, Dick makes
you set down the suitcase. "No clothes out there, dude!" ("But that
means she'll have to walk all the way across the pool deck stark naked!"
"Oh, well!")

You automatically leave it there. The suitcase appears inside the tunnel
(but visible through the wall) and remains there until Drew goes to your
room with you. We see her cross the pool deck, then cut to Larry's room.

Exiting the cabana to the left always takes you to 300. Swimming Pool
while wearing the Codmaster. Exiting to the right always takes you to
the map.

=A\</&\'!//\
In this shot we can see the full length of Drew lying in her chaise
lounge, her nipples hidden by the smallest of palm fronds, her crotch by
her laptop computer. Since she's permanently planted here, she has every
comfort imag-inable. A table holds a book, her drink, sunscreen, etc. If
you Look at it, you learn the book is The Erotic Adventures of Hercules.
If you Talk to her, we cut to 304. Drew Baringmore C. U. below.

If she's in your shower, you can just Take her book. If she is here and
hasn't been in your room, Take is not an option. Instead, you must Talk
to her about it in the C. U. below; when you do, you get it and it
enters Inventory that way. If she is here and has been in your room, the
book is lying there, she's asleep, and ("I'd hate to disturb her!") you
just Take it.

When you get to this scene immediately after having left Drew's suitcase
with Dick, we don't go to her C. U., but instead, we hear you announce
your success. She answers during the pic change, so when we return to
the Pool L. S. she's already standing.

=A=/&\'! /B/\
Immediately after your first conversation, Drew orders a drink. If the
game owner recorded the files properly, he gets to hear his own voice
playing the waiter. Drew orders, "Oh, waiter! Over here....I want a
gigantic erection!" Game owner's voice answers, "Looks like your buddy's
got you covered!" Drew, "What? I said, 'bring me a gigantic erection!'"
GO, "Well, okay, baby. I'm your man!" Drew, "Well, where is it?" GO,
"I'm working on it. Would you mind moving that computer?!" Drew says,
"Look. I want a drink! A cocktail! You know: lime juice, 151-proof rum,
vodka, triple sec, and mayonnaise. A gigantic erection." GO: "Oh. Right
away. That'll take a while, you know."

"I just love nudism. I always get rid of all my clothing as soon as I
board ship." "I make the cabin boy lock up my suitcase for the duration
of the trip so there's no way I can be tempted to leave here." "I eat,
sleep, sun, and swim the entire cruise." "Aren't you worried about
over-exposure?" "No, I just rub this SPF-300 all over my naked body."
Larry moans. "And, of course, my laptop computer offers some protection,
although I hate that peculiar tan line." "I hope I'm not making this
hard for you..." "No, it's been hard since I got here!" "I could see
that!"

"Most men bore me." But once you find her book in the ship's library,
you realize she must be interested in aviation history, since she
literally "wrote the book" on the Fokker aircraft company. If you Type
in "Fokker," you get a lot of new conversation topics. ("Yes, Anton was
wonderful...but his mother really ran that company. She was a tyrant who
ruled with an iron fist!" Larry says, "You mean..." Drew replies, "Yes,
she was one mean mother Fok-ker!")

Now she's slightly interested in you. ("You know, I could Fokker all
night long!" Larry: "Funny. That's exactly what I was thinking!") She
agrees to go back to your room with you...to discuss Fokker, of course.
"I would, but I had the cabin boy lock up my clothing for the duration
of the cruise. You know I can't walk naked through the
cloth-ing-required parts of the ship. So I guess I'll just have to stay
here."

Your problem is obvious: you must get her dressed. (Larry thinks, "I
can't believe I'm trying to get a totally na-ked woman into her
clothing!")

As you stand here, the screen slowly drifts downward (literally a pixel
at a time), until (just before you see any-thing) she interrupts your
stare with, "Excuse me! Do you mind looking me in the eyes?" (Wear the
earplugs during this scene for the show-all Easter egg!)

If you Talk to Drew about Book, you ask about The Erotic Adventures of
Hercules, lying on the table beside her. She says she's finished it, you
can have it. ("It just doesn't have enough sex for me, Larry.")

When Drew says something provocative, Larry's codpiece rears its
elephant trunk into the bottom of the frame while we hear an elephant
trumpet.

Used to provide interest during conversations. A different camera angle
shows another side of her body, and Larry standing there in his
CodMaster 2000.

You only get here by coming through the Boning Exterior, below.

Your first time here, the room is pitch black, lit only by the moonlit
sea outside the nearly all-glass far wall, ris-ing and falling as the
ship heaves to and fro. Between it and the camera we watch a black Larry
silhouette. As Larry moves around, he randomly bumps into (unseen)
things, causing cartoon animations of pain, lightning bolts, etc. to
appear. A glass door leads to the large balcony overlooking the nude
pool.

A suggestive shape lies on the bed; it must look like Annette, but it's
really old man Boning. You stumble around, bumping into things, but
eventually you must choose "undress." When you first approach the bed,
the Cy-berSniff 2000 logo flashes the "gardenia" smell, smell #4.

We see a silhouette of Larry undressing, then a flash of bedclothes
whipping open and closed as Larry climbs into bed. We then hear audio
only: some funny Larry cooing sounds, some heavy breathing, then some
very heavy breathing, wheezing, and coughing. At some point we realize
the person in bed is not Annette, but old Mr. Boning instead. Larry, of
course, thinks the sound of the respirator is just Annette's heavy
breathing. We hear Boning's heart monitor kick in, accelerate, and
finally flat line. Only then does Annette enter from the living room,
clad in only a filmy nightgown. She turns on the light, and we cut to
Boning Suite, Lit below.

=;;/7D\
If you don't know Annette's cabin number, you can't get here. Once you
learn her cabin number, clicking her room number on your Map brings you
here.

A luxurious set of ornate double French doors is surrounded by fancy
molding, sculptures, plants, a doorbell button, and tiki torches.
Through the outer glass doors, you can see another private bank-vault
door.

Your first time here, before showing the room, we display a black screen
with the text, "Late that evening..." when we you arrive at night to
find the doors unlocked. Whenever you leave the Boning Suite (whether
you solve the puzzles or not), we display "The Next Day..." upon your
arrival in your room.

If you try to Ring the doorbell, "She said she'd leave the door
unlocked..." If you try the door, it is, in fact, unlocked. We see you
slip inside, then cut to the Boning Suite above.

Once the old man's dead, you can return here (to the exterior only) at
any time to "discuss our little problem." If you try the door, it's
locked. You must ring the doorbell. Annette comes to the outer door but
she keeps you standing outside. When you talk to her, we cut back and
forth between 312. Widow Boning C. U., and 313. Larry Boning C. U.
below.

=;\</)\*\' /B/\
As this scene begins, the CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "gardenia"
smell, smell #4. If you Use Annette's billion-dollar life insurance
policy on her, we hear you and her negotiate (using this C. U. and the
Larry C. U. below (plus sub-titles) until they reach a decision. She
presumes blackmail, you never mention it. You "just want to discuss our
little problem." Larry is just confused. Eventually, Annette gives you a
stock certificate for the oil shipping com-pany she just inherited
("What the hell? It's not these thirty other companies won't be
enough!") instantly turning you into "Larry Laffer, shipping magnate!"

It's clear what she's thinking (and you're not!) because of the
sub-titles beneath your respective sides of the screen. Be sure to leave
plenty of room on these pictures for sub-titles.

This is all handsOff. This is the bedroom scene after Annette turns on
the lights. Now we can see it was old Mr. Boning lying in bed beside
Larry. Larry spies Annette at the door, does a take at Mr. B., then
leaps from the bed. "I thought you were..." "Next door? Yes."

She quickly assesses the situation and assumes Larry must be one cool
character, lying down with the man he killed. Larry assumes she thinks
he's homosexual. "Nice going, Larry. Let me shut this off before it
'wakes the dead!'" she says coldly. Larry responds, "I hope you don't
think..." "It doesn't matter what I think. What matters is we get rid of
all the evidence," she says as she throws Larry's clothes out the
porthole. "These clothes probably have fingerprints on them!!" "Well, I
don't know that that was necessary." "You are the cool one, aren't you?"
"But how will I get back to my room?" "Oh, we'll find you something
around here..."

> We next see Larry returning to his room stark naked again, his

3\$!

Larry enters this room through Xqwzts's hidden tunnels. In keeping with
the Annette, darkness, lady-in-black, film noir theme, this scene is
dark, the only thing visible is the rising and falling of the moon-lit
ocean outside the porthole. But you can hear extremely erotic sounds
coming from what's obviously a large group of people. "Oh, God!" "Yes!"
"Oh, that's great!" "Perfect." "More!"

Larry thinks, "What a ship! They even have orgies!" You stumble around,
bumping into things, but eventually you must choose "undress." "I'd
better take off all my clothes!" He does, still in complete blackness.
"Okay girls! Which one of you wants to be first to meet the meat man?!"
The room turns deadly silent! A man's voice says gruffly, "What did you
say?" as we hear someone turn on the light. Go to 324. Blind Dessert
Tasting Interior, Lit, below.

=\<\</\*&68\
This is a continuation of 320, above, with the lights on. Now we can
finally see a room full of clothed people nibbling at desserts. Annette
Boning sits in a prominent position with old Mr. Boning beside her in
his wheelchair. She's wearing a dramatic black 40's woman's suit trimmed
in white with a white hanky in her breast pocket, her face nearly hidden
behind a large-brimmed black and white floppy straw hat.

Larry stands in the middle of the dessert table, naked as a jay bird,
facing us, his genitals hidden by a corner of the chocolate moose's
antler. Horrified, he holds his hands in front of himself, covering his
genitals. Then he spies a small sign on the far wall and we hear him
think, "Blind Dessert Taste Test? Whew! That was close." He says out
loud, "It's nice to see you blind people having a good time!" Upon
which, one man flings open the door, while two large men grab Larry and
heave him out into the hallway, naked once again. "Idiot!" "Fool!"
"Miniaturist!"

> Once again he has to sneak back to his room naked. When he gets there,
> he finds Annette waiting for him.

=\<=/\*&8\*\*\
Once you've been thrown out, the crowd disperses and the room is empty
from now on. You can just walk back in any time. Whenever you enter this
scene, the CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "chocolate" smell, smell #9.

But, of course it smells like chocolate in here; that's what they were
taste-testing! But as you near the chair in which Annette Boning sat
(there's an opening beside it that formerly contained old Mr. Boning),
the CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "gardenia" smell, smell #4. If you
Look at that chair, we go to 323. Annette's Chair C. U. below.

This pic is the same as pic 324, but without people, with lots of melted
chocolate stains on the carpet, etc. The place is a mess. You can Smell
chocolate throughout the room. Annette's chair is in the same position
it was, with a small slip of paper visible beside it. If you Look at her
chair, we go to 323. Annette's Chair C. U.

Beside the chair, a piece of folded paper lies on the floor. If you
notice it, you can Take it. It's the billion-dollar life insurance

your "attempted blackmail" a success.

The ship's restaurant contains dining tables stretching off into the
distance, a buffet line, and a locked door lead-ing to a private dining
room.

The locked door protects the Blind Dessert Tasting room. You can't get
inside unless you've already been in-side. Signs on the door (which are
too far away to be read except by a Look) discourage admittance: "Closed
to the public -- Members only!" "Do not enter!" "18 and Older Only!"
Impressive, movie poster-sized promotional an-nouncements on either side
of the door (which can also only be read with a Look) contain chocolate
reviewers' quotes with sexual implications: "Totally decadent...I was
stunned!" "I found myself in a sensuous frenzy!" "an erotic ecstasy..."
"Better than Cats!"

But of course you want in, don't you? But there's no way to open this
door. The door may as well be one-cell and non-animated, since it's
either locked and closed, or standing wide open (after you've crawled
inside through X's vent). But once you've been inside, when you return
here the door is wide open and you can just walk right in. There is no
sound then, of course, as the party's over. As you walk around the
restaurant, if the door is locked, the volume of the sexual frenzy
sounds emanating from within the Dessert Tasting varies directly with
your distance to the door (like Backstage in Tenebrous in Torin\'s
Passage).

If you click the hors d\'oeuvre table and select Eat, Larry turns his
back to the camera, muses, "I love bean dip!" Now you can fart in
several opportune places. Whenever you do, the CyberSniff 2000 logo
flashes the "fart" smell, smell #5.You can always return here for more.

If you click the buffet line and select Eat, we cut to 331. Buffet Line
M. S. below. Wang is always visible behind his carving station, unless
you've driven him off via your incessant s'Porking. He returns as soon
as you leave the restaurant and re-enter.

==;/\$\$//\
This is where you get the heat lamps for the Juggs' performance and the
carving knife for cutting the sails. Larry gets plenty of s'Pork to eat
("It's like Spam, only not so expensive!" Larry: "This stuff is
great!").

You can either Talk to Wang (asking him for "a serving of your delicious
s'Pork") or click on the metal pig-with-apple-shaped chafing dish and
select Take. Either way, you stand in place as Wang lifts the top half
of the pig, removes one of the two metal ham-shaped tin cans within,
twists its screw to open it, tosses away the lid, holds the can over
your plate while a five-pound gelatinous glob of s'Pork slowly slides
out of the can and plops onto your plate. You down it right then and
there, never moving.

You can then Talk to Wang again (and ask for more s'Pork) or Take the
s'Pork again. You still eat it right there. But it's now easy to see
that Wang has no more s'Pork left inside his warming pig. Wang excuses
himself to "fetch more s'Pork from to the kitchen." He then exits the
frame never to return, until you leave the restaurant. If you re-enter
the restaurant later, he's there once again, with a full load of s'Pork.

> While Wang is gone, you can Take the bulb from the heat lamp over the

The ship's lobby should be incredibly huge, overblown, over-the-top, out
of proportion...you get the idea. Gaudy, outlandish decor. This room
uses the smallest Larry of the game. The purser's desk is a small area
in one corner. Other doors lead to the ballroom, the casino lobby, the
restaurant, etc.

There is a hotel telephone here. If you Use it, we see tiny Larry pick
up the phone, hear a ringing sound, see the Purser pick up his phone,
and hear him answer. We get a new Talk interface, consisting of mostly
bad grade-school phone pranks, "Prince Albert," "Seymour Butts," etc.
plus Other.... The Purser thwarts all the pranks, but Larry goes ahead
with the punch line anyway. The puzzle is: select Other, type in
"Boning" get connected to the Boning suite, the old man answers, Larry
says, "Are you Boning?" Old man replies, "I was 'til this damn phone
rang!" You hang up and go to the Purser's Desk.

> If you talk to the Purser we go to 341. Purser's Desk M. S.

=\>;/&\"//\
This is not nearly as close up as most of the other talk screens. We
need room to show him dialing the telephone and leaving this pic to
check on "other information." Behind the Purser's Desk sits the woman
with the airport voice-over announcer's voice. She's reading a magazine,
but periodically leans over a microphone and says in a soft voice,
"Bowling balls may not be removed from the bowling competition area."
Or, "Dice may not be removed from the craps table." Or, "Horseshoes may
not be removed from the horseshoe competition area." Or, "The white
courtesy zones are for loading and unloading only."

You must get back your Passport from him. He's a paranoid,
ultra-suspicious, conspiracy theorist, over-the-top bureaucrat. If you
type in the talk topic, "passport," he tells you must produce a photo ID
to get your passport back. The joke here is: all his bureaucratic
wrangling is for naught. "You must have a photo ID to get a photo ID."
"Don't bother me with details." "What are you up to?" "Are you trying
something?"

If you offer him the home-made photo ID, he leaves this M. S. for a few
seconds, then returns with your passport and gives it to you. It enters
Inventory.

If you type in "Boning," he makes homosexual inferences. If you type in
"room number," he refuses to give out the room numbers of the guests. If
you type in "telephone," he tells you to use the telephone across the
lobby.

If you select "my account," he leaves this M. S. for a few seconds to
check your files. While he's gone, if you Look at the telephone, we go
to 342. Purser's Telephone C. U.

Just the standard buttons, plus a 1-line LCD display, plus a "redial"
button, all clearly labeled, but upside-down to the player. Look at the
upside-down telephone, you can see a key marked Redial. If you press
redial, you can read the last number the purser dialed displayed on the
phone's LCD screen. Draw this so the programmers can easily position the
font in the LCD display. Work it out together.

After you phone the Boning suite, go to the Purser's Desk, talk to him

number. Larry says, "GO OIL? Yeah, that's real helpful! What good does
that do me?" Narrator replies, "That's 71009, Larry! It's upside-down!"
"Oh. I knew that." "7 indicates a guest room on this ship; 1009 is the
actual room number." "Oh. Yeah. Okay." This is how you learn the
Bonings' room number. Once you've seen their number on the LCD display,
room 1009 shows up on the Map.

The ceiling here is about two stories high, giving the casino a spacious
feel, but not as large as the main lobby. Larry is fairly small here.
This room is the site of the world's largest (and only) Venus de Milo
replica made entirely from old casino dice and a similar-sized replica
of Michelangelo's David made entirely from old playing cards. Mostly
this room is a walk thru to get from the lobby to the casino proper.

> marked by intense realism and revolutionary use of light.

A sculptor applies the finishing touches to Venus from atop a large
elaborate scaffold that completely surrounds the statue. He's nearly
done so we can tell what it is he's trying to make. Greeked signs on the
scaffold read (if you Look at them), "Pardon Our Dice!" "Progress Rolls
On!" "Grow We Must!"

=@;/\'1\
Same basic pic as 360, but with a huge pile of dice on the floor where
once a giant proud sculpture stood.

When we first come back here from 362. Venus's Toe C. U., the sculptor
sits atop the scaffold crying. He re-mains there until you leave the
room. Subsequent times in here, he's gone. When the sculptor is on the
scaffold, you can't climb the scaffold. After he's gone, you can. The
animation shows Larry begin his climb, but we quickly cut to 363. Top of
the Scaffold C. U.

If you're returning here after climbing down from 363. Top of the
Scaffold C. U., we see only the last few frames as you get off the
scaffold.

If you made the electromagnet and use the remote control in this pic
(after descending), we see the chase lights come on up near the ceiling
and humorous metal objects (slot machine, safe, anvil, wheelchair) come
flying to it from all around. You quickly (and automatically) turn off
the lights to "save the batteries for later!" All the metal objects fall
on the top platform of the scaffold, conveniently out of sight.

=@\</% /B/\
This is a handsOff cut scene showing Larry reach in to pull out two dice
from Venus's toe. As soon as his hand clears the pic, we cut to 364.
Larry Reacts to Crash C. U.

=@=/\$\$\$\* /B/\
After climbing the scaffold in 361. Lobby with Rubble, we arrive at this
C. U. We see the final few frames of Larry completing his climb over the
edge to get here. The sculptor's tools are lying around. The steel stake
from the horseshoe competition sticks obviously (and ominously) through
the ceiling from above. You can Look at the stake, Feel it, etc.

You can Take the sculptor's screwdriver from his tool kit. ("The only
tool you need is the screwdriver!" "I re-member back at La Costa Lotta I
needed two tools!" "You don't here." "How do you know?" "I read ahead in
the script" "Oh...So tell me: do I get laid?" "Not that much!")

As you learned by reading the Fun with Electromagetism book in the
library, you can use the chase lights on the iron stake. We see Larry
wrap the Christmas light-like wires around and around the iron stake.
After wrapping the

lights around the stake but before descending the scaffold, if you use
the remote control we see the chase lights come on and attract Larry's
iron medallion, pulling him almost off his toes (but not throwing him to
his death on the dice pile below). You automatically turn off the lights
to "save the batteries for later!" and Larry drops back to normal view
stop walker.

A C. U. of Larry's facial reactions to a giant collapsing dice Venus de
Milo (instead of animating that!). Larry smiles, thinks "Nobody will
ever miss these!", but as soon as that line is over, we hear a loud
off-screen roar of the collapsing dice sculpture while we see Larry
react. When the roar is over, we cut back to 361. Lobby with Rubble,
where we see the pile of dice rubble.

This is a handsOff cut scene showing Larry reach in to pull out a card
from David's toe, but can't. As soon as his hand clears the pic, we cut

This pic is more of a L. S. so we can show lots of different gambling
going on, using lots of (small, repetitive) animation, waitresses
bustling around, etc. But its only real features are the craps table,
plus an exit to the casino lobby and another to the employees' break
room.

The craps table is in the foreground and has the most animation: a
croupier, what appears to be all the James Bond actors and some of the
major Bond babes cheering them on. A waitress walks by, we hear,
"Cocktails, any-one?" following by all of them simultaneously, "Martini:
shaken, not stirred."

There are also several blackjack tables where the only movement is the
dealer. Keep them consistent so we can use one set of animation for all
the tables. There are also a couple of roulette tables: show the
spinning wheel and the dealer reaching for chips. Keep them consistent
so we can use one set of animation for all the tables. There's a wheel
of fortune with an operator and the spinning wheel. There are banks of
slot machines in far distance. All we really need there is some gaudy
light animation, but no people. Access to those other games is blocked.

In the rear of the casino, an exit feature leads you to a hallway
outside the employees' break room. Click it and we see Larry walk off
the pic behind a wall before we cut to 381. Break Room Door.

> Another exit feature takes you to 360. Casino Lobby.

When you click on the craps table and select Play, you get one of the
following responses, "It's too crowded now." "That guy's been winning a
long time." "There's no room for you there." "No one leaves a craps
table while the shooter's hot!" and you don't get to enter the game.

The only way to enter the craps game is to go to the restaurant, eat the
bean dip, stand near the current hot roller, click on Larry and select
Fart. We then cut to 374. Larry Cuts the Cheese,

When we return, the table has cleared out and Larry is able to play.
Click the table, select Play, and we cut to 371. Craps Table.

Once you leave the area while the table's empty, it fills back up again
(conveniently with the same people) so you must go through the entire
fart process again.

=;/\
This is a M. S. showing the table from Larry through the Croupier. If
you Use your scorecard on the Croupier, we see you purchase \$100 in
chips ("Just charge that to my room, Garçon."). There's a little table
chatter, then we see the croupier push the dice toward you. When you
Take the dice, they enter your Inventory as "Dice, Legal."

If you try to exit the area while the dice are in Inventory, we hear
that airport voice-over announcer's voice say, "Dice may not be removed
from the craps table."

You can then Use any of the various dice on the table. As soon as you
do, we cut to 372. Larry Rolls for the ac-tual roll and results. After
you lose everything, we return here. If you win, we go to 373. Hello,
Dewmi! instead.

If you try to Save (or Restore?) your game during this sequence, we hear
the croupier say, "What? Save your game, Mr. Laffer? Are you trying to
cheat?" Larry responds: "Uh, no, I'm not."

When you try to leave this scene, the croupier demands his dice back.
You must then Use the proper dice on the table in order to get away. If
you try to return the shaved dice, we cover for you by having Larry say,
"Just a minute. I've got your dice...right...here...someplace!" putting
the dice on the table (only one set of animation needed for all these
possibilities) and we remove the Legal Dice from Inventory instead.

=\</1\
This is a simple M. S. showing Larry speak (expectant, then resigned,
then confident), shake the dice (needs a talker for several different
lines like, "Bet it all on Come. Heh, heh." Then we hear Larry think,
"With a name like that, it's gotta do good!" "Baby needs platform
shoes!"), roll (same animation every time), and then react to the
re-sults of the roll (happy, mostly sad or "Doh!").

If you used the "Dice, Legal" in 371. Craps Table, you always lose
everything. ("I guess don't come is more my speed.") You don't die.
Instead you just continue to charge \$100 worth of chips to your room
forever until you real-ize that's not the solution.

If you used the "Dice, Souvenir" in 371. Craps Table, then before
rolling we hear Larry ask, "Is it okay if I use these dice I picked up
from the lobby floor?" And of course the croupier answers, "No!"

If you used the "Dice, Shaved" in 371. Craps Table, you roll and win.
Instead of returning to 371, we remain here. Larry cries, "Let it ride!"
and rolls again. After a few times of that (probably 3?), we cut to 373.
Hello, Dewmi!

==/58&\'!E\
Dewmi arrives, sees you're winning big, hangs all over you for a roll or
two, (she needs at least a couple of sug-gestive talkers, and Larry
needs one that says, in effect, "Is this really happening to me?"). She
then invites you to her room, and tells you her room number. We playback
the sequence from the Demo ("I'll get the dice..." "...wear a cup?")

> From then on, 510. Dewmi Moore's Cabin appears on the map. Clicking
> there takes you inside her room.

=\>/ /B/\
Just a quick cut scene showing a C. U. of Larry's face. He goes through
three distinct stages: first, straining to lay the big bomb; then
second, smiling at his success; and finally third, grimacing as he
realizes just how foul it really is. When he smiles, the CyberSniff 2000
logo flashes the "fart" smell, smell #5. At the same time, we hear the
off-screen craps table crowd moan, groan, and scurry away. We then
automatically cut back to 370 to find the craps table empty.

39\$1\":4+\
Inside this room are buried several things the player needs as well as
some information he may need to finish the game.

There is a locker bay on one wall. If you click on the correct locker
(TBA) and select Open, you are prompted for the combination. If you type
in "38 24 36" (ignore punctuation, hyphens, commas, etc.), we cut to
386. Locker Bay Rising below.

If you are returning here from any of the Xqwzts scenes below, during
the pic change, we hear the sounds of hy-draulics and compressed air as
the massive locker bay returns to its "fully-upright and vertical
position." We don't actually see it close, but when you get here you are
once again standing before a closed set of lockers.

> There is a bulletin board on one wall. If you Look at it, we cut to
> 382. Bulletin Board C. U. below.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a bowl sitting on the cabinet under the bulletin board. If you
Look at it, we hear the Narrator say, "No dice!" To which Larry says,
"Doh!"

There is a cabinet under the bulletin board. If you Look at it, you
learn there's a bottle of KZ Jelly. ("KZ! It's not just a Sexual
Lubricant, it makes an excellent Roulette Wheel Polish too!") You can
take it.

=;/\"1!5\'\
Signs on the door read, "Authorized Personnel Only," there's a laser
bar-code scanner, a Tongue Reader, and a 10-key pad. Surrounding the
door is an array of security devices, including following cameras, a
giant concrete ball, sword points extending from the walls, machine guns
emplacements, etc. If you select Open, "What? You think you can just
ignore all these defense mechanisms and waltz right in just by pushing
the door open?" But if you type "Push," Larry (in a blatant violation of
adventure game protocol) just pushes the door open and walks right in!
Why? Because (just like our office door at SNW) latch doesn't work
properly.

=\</\* /B/\
A typical office bulletin board, but with some humorous announcements,
each of which you can hear Larry read out loud if you click on them and
select Read. All the signs are Greeked. You can't read any of them
without a Look. "Dealing from the bottom of the deck seminar." "If they
can't take a joke, bar 'em!" "My kid can beat your kid at craps!"
"Fleecing the Chump lecture series" "Widows? Orphans? Fools!"

However, you can recognize a wire hanging near a sign. It has an
alligator clip on each end. The sign by it says, "Attention Pit Bosses:
Attach this to slots to prevent jackpots." You can Take the Jumper Wire.

The board also contains a nicely lettered Greeked sign. If you Look at
it, Larry reads it aloud: "Attention Crou-piers: It has come to the
attention of management that cheaters have been using shaved dice. These
dice look com-pletely innocent, except one face has been shaved with
sandpaper, making them win every time. This is bad for business! Even
worse: these dice are undetectable to the naked eye. So as soon as you
see them, confiscate them.

Deposit them in the bowl below."

=@/\"1\
The entire locker bay is hinged at the top rear, and when opened,
quickly raises up, slamming a powerful upper-cut to Larry's jaw. This
happens every time Larry opens the locker to talk to Xqwzts, even though
Larry makes comments about dodging, stepping back, etc. How come he
never does? He's just dumb.

Since this is merely a cut scene and it plays exactly the same every
time, draw it from the angle that makes the joke look best. Go for the
laugh since there's no game play.

> If Xqwzts is still around, we go to 387. Xqwzts's Stall below. If not,
> go to 388. Post-Xqwzts's Stall below.

Inside sits Xqwzts, as if in a casbah stall, waiting for you. Here you
talk and negotiate with him. We see a vent on the wall behind Xqwzts,
plus the hook where he hangs his keys, and the credit card imprinter.

If you've had sex with at least one other woman, he'll sell you lewd
photos of yourself having sex. "Just charge it to my room." "Okay," and
he pulls out a credit card imprinter. He accepts your room card as
payment and runs it through his credit card scanner.

If you haven't had sex with at least one other woman, his photos are of
some other passenger. You choose not to buy.

Once Xqwzts is gone, he leaves his key ring hanging up inside his area.
You can take it, and the Master Key en-ters Inventory. You use it to
gain access to the lower regions of the ship.

Once Xqwzts is gone, you can Look at the back wall and discover a vent
that provides access to the hidden pas-sageways throughout the ship that
Xqwzts formerly traveled, photographing passengers.

If you Use the screwdriver on the vent, you enter the passageway. We see
you crawl out of this scene and we cut to 389. Up Xqwzts's Vent

This is a completely black screen, with just audio. We hear the sounds
of you crawling through an air duct. Soon the same porno soundtrack from
the Blind Dessert Tasting scene fades in. Soon, it's full volume. You
can either use the Screwdriver anywhere on the black screen, or use the
Exit feature to take you back where you came from. You go on and you are
in 320. Blind Dessert Tasting Interior. (Of course, it's all black too,
so you can't really tell the differ-ence graphically.)

Alleys stretch completely across the aft end of the ship, but
fortunately, the nearest lane is always open. You can always see other
contestants bowling in the background, stretching off into the distance.
Each is a Greek god hunk in a tiny Speedo, muscular, fit, gorgeous,
everything a woman might want in a man (in other words, everything Larry
is not!). Each follows the same routine: he gets a ball (from somewhere
not necessarily visible), wipes it with a cloth, inserts the cloth in
the front of his tiny Speedo, then bowls.

This area has another card-reading ball-dispensing ATM-style automated
machine for entrants in the "Thygh's Man Trophy" contest, similar to the
Centaur horseshoe machine, only this one is a giant topiary rabbit
dispensing bowling balls out its ass like rabbit pellets. If you Use the
scorecard on the rabbit, it doesn't keep your card and pinches off one
bowling ball turd. You must then Take the ball. It enters Inventory. If
you try to exit the area while the bowling ball is in Inventory, we hear
that airport voice-over announcer's voice say, "Bowling balls may not be
removed from the bowling area." Looking at the bowling ball reveals,
"You know, the other contestants wiped their balls first." While the
ball is in Inventory, you may treat it with "Annette's specially
lubricated hanky."

When you finally click on the alley and select Bowl, or Use the Bowling
Ball, we cut to 391 Up Your Alley be-low to see the results. Upon
returning here, a voice synthesizer inside the rabbit's ass announces
your success. If you missed, you hear, "The ship's movements cause your
balls to careen madly." Larry: "Yeah, I know; but how could you tell?"

If you treated the bowling pins, and you've treated the hanky with the
KZ Jelly, and you insert your card into the bunny, you get the following
handsOff sequence: you take the bowling ball, automatically rub your
ball with and bowl. We cut to 391 Up Your Alley below, to see the
results.

=G;/BC(\
In the lower left corner flashes the CyberAlleyCam 2000 logo. This shot
looks down the alley towards the pins and the rear of the ship, from the
center of the alley, from a height of one inch. The pins are not too
large, just large enough to make it obvious what they are and that the
balls and pins fall right off the back of the ship. Leave plenty of
headroom for the explosions that will occur later when Larry finds the
right combination of ingredients.

There are 4 loops needed here: Larry's left-gutter ball, right-gutter
ball, the pins being reset, and the explosion. We cut to this shot just
as Larry's ball passes the camera, so it begins huge, rolls away from us
down the alley to the pins, stirs them up, then clearly rolls off the
back of the deck. We hear a distant splash, then the whine of motors
(the same sound as in the 500. Pin-Setter Hold below, only softer)
lifting a new set of pins into position. We then cut back to 390.
Bowling Competition Area above.

If you've Used the treated hanky on your ball, we see the dripping ball
roll down the alley, throwing off globs of KZ Jelly everywhere. When it
reaches the pins, they literally explode in a small mushroom cloud,
leaving no trace of anything ever. We then cut back to 390. Bowling
Competition Area above.

This is an extreme L. S. showing the bowl-shaped glass bottom of the
nude swimming pool protruding down from the ceiling. This provides for
fun background animations of the nude swimmers, volleyball players, etc.
Larry is extremely small here (10% perhaps?) Other than the ceiling pool
bottom, this is just a large convention hall, set up with a runway,
theatrical lights, foot lights, stage curtains, bunting, rows of chairs
facing the stage, tables and chairs behind, etc. There's nothing much to
do but look at the naked swimmers or walk over to Jamie. When you do, we
cut to...

\>A;/,!//\
This shows more of Jamie Lee than just her face, as it's the only good
pic we have of her. Talk to Jamie and learn her problem. Type in
"leisure suit" and Larry suggests she go retro. She flips, thinks
Larry's a genius, but now she has a bigger problem: she needs white
polyester and lots of it!

If you Use the polyester fabric on Jamie, she responds, "Quick! Take off
all your clothes!" "Well, okay!" "There's no time to waste. I need your
leisure suit for a pattern, Larry!" "I want your underwear, too." "Why?"
"No time to explain!" So again, you return to your room wearing nothing
but a thread bobbin this time...and you didn't even get laid!

A simple hallway showing a pair of doors leading into 400. Jamie's
Ballroom above, and another smaller door leading backstage, resulting in
the cartoon, 403. Leisure Suits Are Back!, below.

If Larry has given Jamie the fabric and hasn't been in 403 yet, there's
a note on the ballroom door, the door to the ballroom (400) is locked
and the back stage door (403) is unlocked. Otherwise (usually), the
opposite is true: 403 is locked and 400 is unlocked. Look at the note
and hear a Jamie-thinker beg, "Larry---meet me backstage."

> Once Larry's been in 403, both doors are locked for the rest of the

When Larry opens the Back Stage Door, we cut to a black screen first,
hear Larry's footsteps, hear him whisper "Jamie? Jamie Lee?" Suddenly,
we hear the first strains of Stayin' Alive begin, we cut to a camera
angle out in the ballroom looking back at a M. S. of the now flood-lit
stage, see the curtains fly open revealing our Larry standing there with
a deer-in-the-headlights, shocked, embarrassed expression. But as the
music continues, we can see the music move through his body, starting
subtly, continuing until he's completely Travolta-ed.

We cut to a longer shot, straight down the runway this time, and Larry
dances his way at the camera, completely uninhibited now. The crowd goes
wild. When he's close enough to the camera to fill the screen from the
groin up, a couple of arms reach into the frame, grab his clothes,
leaving him wearing just his hearts-covered boxers. We fade to black and
a pair of boxers goes flying across the screen. So again, you return to
your room wearing nothing but a camera with flash and zoom lens this
time...and again, you didn't get laid!

It's the LuvMaster 2000. Dig it!

The simulator looks like a row of dressing rooms or voting booths, with
half doors revealing legs inside all but one of them. We hear
properly-panned, pornographic sounds coming from each occupied booth,
along with a few appropriate foot and leg movements. The booths are
drawn flat, straight-on from the front so we can use the same set of LED
numerals for each booth's score display. The scores go up slowly above
each occupied booth.

Larry can enter the competition at any time just by Using his scorecard
on the one unoccupied booth's scorecard reader. We go into handsOff and
see Larry open the curtains, pausing briefly before going inside. He
does a small take when he sees what's inside: a robotic-looking,

ward position. He's in and out in a flash (around 3 seconds?), receiving
a score of 3. ("Wow! I bet I was in there an hour!") Upon leaving, we
can once again see the mannequin; she's unchanged.

The correct answer is to get Vicki to take this test for you. In the
library, after having sex with her, you talk her into a bet that you
could outscore her on a sex quiz. She agrees to use your scorecard to
take the test ("just to prove who's the expert around here!"). We return
here from the library in handsOff to see Vicki open the curtains,
pausing briefly before going inside so we can see the mannequin is
unchanged. Vicki sets the score display spinning, aces the test, sets a
new high score, and leaves the curtains open so we can see the metallic
mannequin inside the booth is now kicked back, relaxed, satisfied and
smoking a cigarette.

Three female judges sit near the back of this scene, taking small bites
of food from plates, passing the plates back and forth, then between
tastes, entering their scores into their laptop computers. The scores
are then processed and displayed on a large overhead LCD panel, along
with the contestant's name. Between entries, the LCD shows humorous
scrolling messages regarding other contestants' entries.

You can wander about this area at any time, but you must present your
scorecard to the head judge (the one in the middle) in order to enter
the Cook-Off. There's a standard scorecard reading machine here, but
this time it's on the table near the center judge.

Present your scorecard and the judge requests your entree. You can then
give the judge various Inventory ob-jects with humorous results, but you
get zero points and an embarrassing scrolling message about your
"assholiness" appears overhead.

Once you give your scorecard to the judge, you can't leave without
taking back. If you click the exit cursor, you automatically walk over
and get your scorecard back before leaving the screen.

You must find the recipe for Venezuelan Beaver Cheese And Kumquat
Quiche, obtain all the ingredients, go to the kitchen and prepare it.
When you return, you give your scorecard to the middle judge, then wait.
You then click the quiche on her, we see her take it from you, taste it
gingerly, then make a terrible face and sounds. She doesn't even bother
passing it along to the other judges ("Trust me. You don't want any of
this one!"). You get a score of 3 points and a rating of "terrible."
Horrible insults get displayed on the overhead scrolling screen.

But if you first add the Orgasmic Powder to the Quiche to make Quiche
d'Larry, when you give it to the first judge she tastes it and becomes
excited. It's like "Harry Met Sally" only times three. ("My God, she's
orgasming." "No, it's multiple orgasms!" "No, it's multiple simultaneous
orgasms!" "No, it's multiple simultaneous on-stage or-gasms!!") They're
barely able to type a perfect "10" into their laptops, ("My laptop is
melting!" "That's nothing. My lap is melting!") before they fall into a
deep psychedelic trance. The CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "Limburger
cheese" smell, smell #8. Thus, Larry gets the first perfect score in
Cook-Off history.

We see a very small library with many shelves that could hold hundreds
of books, all of which are checked out except for the few titles we
need. The book titles are all funny, except for the following, placed
there merely to hold clues:\
•  Fun with Electromagetism\
English physicist William Sturgeon, 40, devises the first electromagnet.
He varnishes an iron bar to insulate it, wraps the bar with copper wire,
connects the wire to the terminals of a voltaic pile, and creates a
crude device that can lift a few pounds of iron (see VOLTA, 1800;
FARADAY, 1821; HENRY, 1827).

> •  Drew Baringmore's book Fokker: More Than Just An Airplane!
>
> Fokker, Anton Herman Gerard (fôk´er), 1890--1939, Dutch-born
> German-American aircraft designer and aircraft manufac-turer; b. Java.
> His factories in Germany produced triplanes and biplanes used in World
> War I. He revolutionized aerial warfare by synchronizing a
> front-mounted machine gun to fire through the propeller of a plane
> without intercepting the blades (1915). He later turned to developing

\>=\</%\"//8\$\
From Larry's POV. Victorian Principles, the repressed librarian, sits
behind a desk with a big stack of books to her left (our right). She is
reading a book, but puts it down as Larry approaches. Other library
desk-type stuff (muci-lage, rubber stamps, desk calendar, etc.) is
arranged pathologically neatly.

You can take the mucilage from her counter as long as she's not watching
you, i.e., she's turned around to look up some information you asked
about. We work the word "mucilage" into as many sentences as possible.
You can't replace the mucilage. And Vicki doesn't miss it.

You can read the titles on the books; they are all prudish, especially
the top book, the one Vicki was reading un-til you interrupted her:
Prudish and Proud.

You can take Prudish and Proud from the pile of books whenever her back
is turned. You must return it before leaving this M. S. If you don't she
tells you to and you do automatically.

However, while Prudish and Proud is in Inventory, you can "remove dust
jacket" and Use the dust jacket on The Erotic Adventures of Hercules to
place the erotic book inside the Prudish dust jacket, and even switch
her bookmark to a particularly saucy passage. Place this newly devised
combo on Vicki's desk to "stimulate her inner woman." The next time you
return to the library, instead of this scene you get Librarian M. S.,
After (see below). Vicki will be a new woman. Literally!

You can Talk to Vicki about any typed-in topic ("I don't know much about
that, but I could look it up for you."), she turns her back on you for
about 15 seconds. She then turns back around and faces you but doesn't
touch her book (either the newly-altered or the old, if you haven't yet
replaced it).

"Aren't you going to read your book?" "No. Later." Which means you must
leave the library, and when you re-turn instead of this scene, you
see...

\>==/%\"//8(\$\
After her transformation. Same basic picture as above, same angle, same
Larry POV.

But now, Vicki has drastically changed her look and her reading
material. Now stuff is strewn all over her desk, not just the stuff that
was there, but much more. She has several messy piles of books, and the
titles are all licentious. Her hair is down, her blouse is unbuttoned
down to there. She looks good...damned good!

The next time you return she's a burning hot babe, surrounded by saucy
books! You're the first man she's seen since her transformation. If you
talk to Vicki about the "weather" (a new topic that appears on her verbs
menu), she somehow turns the conversation into "Let's screw." She pulls
you across the counter and has wild sex with you. She rips your clothes
off your body; shreds of white polyester clothing fly everywhere.
However, she's finished in just a few seconds, after which she raises
up, straightening her hair, and resumes reading. Larry, of course, is
now naked, and must sneak back to his cabin with nothing but a pair of
books to cower behind. "Hey! What do I do now? You've wrecked my
clothes!" "Oh, don't worry, Larry. I can loan you a jacket." You return
to your room wearing nothing but a (dust) jacket.

The Easter egg here appears if you type in just the right phrase during
the sex act, we change camera angles and actually see her ride you --
but not for long.

*After sex*\
You can return here again later, only to find Vicki has grown past you
sexually and is unwilling to repeat your previous encounter. In fact she
says, "Since you were here, I've done nothing but read about sex. I feel
certain I'm now most sexually-knowledgeable person on this ship." You
doubt her and ask her to prove it. "I'm not going to prove it with you.
You weren't that good the last time." You must type in "LuvMaster 2000"
as a topic. "I know an objective way." "But I can't; I'm an employee."
"I could give you my Scorecard." "Okay."

A small room with a circular platform for Larry to stand on, a monitor
in the foreground, a large ENIAC-style 50's computer console covered
with flashing lights covering the back wall, and another card-reading
automated ma-chine for entrants in the "Thygh's Man Trophy" contest,
similar to the LuvMaster 2000, only this one is a shiny metallic male
humanoid who scans your card via a hand laser bar-code reader that comes
out of his fly.

Use your scorecard on the mannequin and get the following handsOff
sequence: Larry reaches in the manne-quin's fly, pulls out the bar-code
scanner, scans his card, returns it (while the mannequin turns to the
camera and breaks out into a smile), then climbs up on the circular
platform, stands still while the base lights up under him with an
unearthly glow. Inside the base a green light slowly revolves like a
sweep second hand, flooding Larry with an unearthly glow as the video
display in the foreground shows our ugly, revolving, Duracell SGI-Larry
created for the January milestone meeting. After the light makes one
complete revolution, it blinks out, Larry steps down, the ENIAC
continues to flash its lights and whir its tape drives, and the
foreground monitor goes black. When the proc-essing is done, a voice
synthesizer inside the mannequin announces your score.

If you haven't satisfied Jamie's needs for polyester, Larry receives a
score of 2. But if you have, Larry receives a perfect score of 100,
making Leisure Suit Larry the world's best dressed guy! Through Jamie
Lee Coitus, you've altered the course of world fashion, though you've
changed not a wit. And thus ends our little social commentary on the
capriciousness of haute couture!

This console contains the ship's powerful neural-net fashion computer,
using state-of-the-art massively-parallel processing to determine a
person's stylishness quotient. Its 3-D scanning synthesizes an image of
whomever stands on its circular scanning platform while the
high-resolution, 2048x2048, 32-bit color monitor displays the resulting
image. The CPU then compares the scanned image with the terabytes of
data stored on the giant tape drives in the background. After computing
an accurate stylishness quotient, it transmits the score to the ship's
central competition computer and reports it here in the Fashion
Competition Chamber through a 44k, 32-bit, 128x-oversampled,
THX-certified voice synthesis system. Hard to believe it all runs off of
one floppy disk!

This hold has to be at the aft end of the ship, directly below the
bowling competition. It should be fairly large, using a 50% Larry to
make the goofy-looking machine look even bigger and sillier. A Rube
Goldberg contraption that doesn't make mechanical sense, but just looks
funny. It periodically spurts steam and compressed air, robotic arms
swing around randomly, pins move on conveyor belts and in hoppers,
contraptions rise up, wheels spin, belts fly, and eventually somehow,
ten little bowling pins are properly positioned in the correct 1-2-3-4
formation just under the deck above, then with a little fanfare, shoved
upwards through ten holes, ostensibly making them appear in 390. Bowling
Competition Area. The pins are clearly visible and recognizable through
the mechanism. There should be no mystery about what this thing does,
only why anyone would waste this much energy and money building it!

If you click here from the map, this is where you arrive. The hold door

Upon entering for the first time (under handsOff), we see Larry and
Dewmi standing near the table. Dewmi of-fers you a drink, you accept and
we cut to 511. Dewmi C. U. -- liar's dice.

Later on (post-Dewmi), you can return here and explore the room. If you
Look at the table where you played dice, you notice the half-used bottle
of Orgasmic Powder. You can Take it.

Note: while you are in this area after winning the dice game, there's no
walking around and you can not Take the powder, as that entire sequence
is handsOff.

Ripped off straight from the demo. You can talk to Dewmi about anything,
but she's got only one thing on her mind -- your money! You must spend

We see Larry awaken in Dewmi's hot tub, groggy, wet, water-soaked, cold,
alone and, of course, naked. Once again, Larry snatches defeat from the
jaws of victory and must sneak back to his cabin naked, this time
wearing noth-ing but dice cups.

You find a large shipping container containing a passel of squirming,
wriggling Venezuelan beavers, pacing around in their cage. The container
holds many cages and each cage holds several beavers. The containers
stretch off into the far distance. This shot should be extreme
perspective, but blocked off so we keep Larry in the foreground. The
first time you enter, the CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "musk" smell,
smell #3.

If you click on the container and type in "milk" and you have the pot in
Inventory, we cut to 522. Beaver C. U. If you don't have the pot, you
can't milk. Give clue if Use Pot on Beaver.

Upon returning here from 522, we see Larry close the door of the last
cage. The beaver milk is now in your In-ventory.

A short cut scene, mostly handsOff. This is the room from the end of
Indiana Jones 3, a gargantuan warehouse stretching back to the horizon,
disappearing into the atmosphere in the distance, filled to the brim
with millions of suitcases. Give the player a few seconds to let the
picture sink in, then Larry says, "Oh, no! How will I ever find Drew's
suitcase among all these? It'd be like finding a needle in a haystack!"
As soon as he finishes that line, a suit-case tumbles into the frame,
hitting Larry on the head.

You can take the suitcase. If you're a total dork and leave without
taking it, you can always come back here and try again. The suitcase
remains on the floor. CyberSniff 2000 displays "musk" smell, smell #3
here.

Always on the map, but you can't open the door until you get the master
key from Xqwzts. This door has an ob-vious keyed lock, a large
watertight gasket, those heavy hinges, plus a big metal wheel to seal it
shut tight. Once you've used Xqwzts's master key on this door and gained
access to 530. Luggage Storage Hold, above, we skip this scene and you
never have to see this door again.

-5\$\<\
No one is ever around here. Evidently, they order out for s'Pork and
bean dip. Every time you enter this scene, if you haven't taken the fish
and its magazine wrapper, the CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "fish"
smell, smell #7.

There is a magazine and a large pot sitting out on the counter. A large,
commercial salt shaker sits hidden behind the pot.

If you Smell the magazine, you get CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the
"fish" smell, smell #7. You can find a fish lying on the counter wrapped
in pages torn from a recent issue of Professional Hash Slinger magazine.
"Sorry, Charlie!"

If you Take the fish, we see you toss the fish into the nearby garbage
can ("Smells like it's turned."), but the pages of Professional Hash
Slinger magazine in which it is wrapped enter Inventory.

In Inventory, you can Read the magazine pages. We hear Larry recite out
loud the recipe for Venezuelan Beaver Cheese. On another page, you learn
how to make Venezuelan Beaver Cheese And Kumquat Quiche. Thank God, or
the game would never end!

You can Take the pot. (Narrator, "This would be good if you need to
'pass the pot,' Larry." Larry, "That's nice; I was so poor growing up, I
never had a pot to pass in!")

Once you take the pot, you can now see a large, commercial-looking salt
shaker sitting here. You can Take the salt. (Narrator, "Pass the salt."
Larry, "That's not funny." Narrator, "Okay, you make the joke!")

To make the cheese or the quiche, you must be in this room. If you use
any ingredient on any other in any other scene, the game suggests the
kitchen is the place for food preparation.

But if you're here and use any ingredient on any other, we check for all
the ingredients. If you're missing any-thing, the game tells you
(Narrator, "Better double-check your recipe, Larry; once again, you're
missing something." Larry, "I wish I had a dollar...")

But if you're here and use any ingredient on any other and you have
everything in Inventory needed to prepare the quiche, we then see a
short handsOff sequence in which Larry starts to mix up a storm and mess
up the kitchen. We fade to black, then immediately fade back in on 541.
Kitchen after quiche below.

?\>;/48(\$9\
We fade in from 540 above to see Larry finish making the quiche. The
CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "Limburger cheese" smell, smell #8. The
quiche is in Inventory. You can then sprinkle the Orgasmic Powder over
the finished quiche to make the Cook-Off-winning concoction, Quiche
d'Larry. This can be done anywhere in the game in Inventory.

You can return here later, but nothing happens. The kitchen stays messed
up like this throughout the rest of the cruise.

A long straight staircase leads down into this room from the entrance
hatch above. After seeing the entrance once, you just appear here, in
the main area of the room.

Make this is the worst stateroom imaginable, the most uncomfortable
situation possible. Larry is literally in the ship's boiler room,
complete with a giant thrusting piston that passes through the wall over
his head, so whenever he lies down all he can see is copulating steel.
(ÒFor some reason, this room makes me feel so inadequate.Ó) Riddled with
symbolism, the engine room is filled with shapes that ostensibly might
have something to do with moving the ship, but upon closer study are
subtle mechanical versions of body parts. It all has an industrial feel.

There is a non-working toilet and an emergency "safety shower." The
toilet has a pipe missing where it connects to the wall. The shower has
a translucent plastic shower curtain that wraps around whomever is
inside. Overhead there's a confusion of plumbing, pipes, steam lines,
sprinkler systems, etc. There's a dripping pipe right above your bed.
Because the ship is constantly rocking back and forth, the water drips
into a bucket on either side of your bed, instead of on your pillow.

If you choose to Lie Down on the bed, the ship stops rocking back and
forth and the water drips right on your face.

>
> There is a can of spray silicone lubricant stuffed into the toilet
> that you can take.

*Drew Baringmore*\
Drew follows you back to your room to discuss "Fokker." Once there, she
says, "I need to rinse off some of that sunscreen, Larry" and hops into
your shower. ("Hmm. Steam is not the only thing rising.") From then on,
whenever you enter your room, she is in the shower. You can converse,
but it's limited to "How'ya doin' in there?" "Okay. Just a little
longer" etc.

> Drew doesn't need a C. U. in this scene, as you only yell back and
> forth through the shower curtain.

The only way to get Drew out of the shower is to use the fire hose to
connect your broken toilet to the water line running visibly across the
top of your room to the shower, then flush the toilet. You accomplish
this by Using the hose on either the overhead pipe or the toilet. Then
we see Larry connect one end of the hose to each. (You do not have to
Use hose on toilet, then Use hose on pipe. One or the other gives you
both.) Then you must Flush the toilet. We see the shower water turn
boiling hot and Drew turn lobster red. She leaps straight out of the top
of the shower stall to the overhead pipes, where she hangs for a beat
before dropping cat-like to the floor. She's pissed, storms out, leaving
behind mold on your shower walls. Which, of course, is the only reason
she's in the game.

Once Drew leaves the shower, you can take the mold from the shower wall.
After all, that's the only reason she's in the game!

*Annette Boning*\
Annette spotted Larry at the blind dessert tasting. As he enters his
room immediately thereafter, he finds her sit-ting here. Somehow she
followed him to his room and got inside before he did! She sits on some
sort of suggestive plumbing, her legs crossed, her long skirt falling
open revealing just enough leg. We can't really see her face. The whole
idea is she's shrouded in mystery. When you talk to her, we cut to 552.
A & L B. J. M. S. below and then back and forth between it and the two
close-ups, 553. Annette Boning's C. U. and 554. Larry's Boning C. U.

Any time after Annette leaves, you can take her merely slightly-soiled
hanky that's still lying on the floor where she dropped it. If you Smell
the hanky, the CyberSniff 2000 logo flashes the "gardenia" smell, smell
#4.

This room, immediately outside Larry's "Cabin," exists only for the
purpose of embarrassing Larry when he's trying to sneak naked back to
his room following "sex." Otherwise, it's just a door we go through once
to establish the location of Larry's Cabin.

The first time you click on the Map screen to go to your room, we come
here, show Larry standing at the door alone. He waits for you to Use the
room key card on the door. Then we cut to Larry's Cabin, below. No big
deal.

But often, whenever Larry loses all his clothes, we fade in from black
to this hallway and see a handsOff se-quence showing Larry trying to
sneak back into his room while completely naked. Each time he almost
gets to his door, thinks a comment like, "At least no one saw me this
time!", and then some stranger appears, comments on his perversity,
slaps, slams, insults and/or hits him, then walks off in a huff.

> Here's what covers Larry's privates:\
> •  after Victorian Principles: a book's dust jacket\
> •  after Juggs: a large Country Music Awards Show belt buckle\
> •  after Dewmi Moore: dice cups\

DESIGN CLARIFICATION: Five of L\'s encounters are sequential, that is,
the first time he shows up here naked we see #1, the next #2. However,
two are determined by the prevRoom. No matter when you come here from
there, you get the prescribed condition. The two determined by prevRoom
are: dessert tasting & Boning bedroom. The five shown in sequence are:
Victorian, Juggs, Dewmi, Jamie pre-show, Jamie post-show.

> We do the five encounters are in this sequence:\
> •  a sweet little old lady\
> •  a busload of Japanese tourists\
> •  a nun\
> a video crew from Inside Affair\
> •  •  Peggy: excited first, measure Larry, then clomps off.

The two previous scene encounters are:\
•  after dessert: a screaming faggot wraps himself around Larry's leg "I
want a bite of THAT!" •  after Boning: a Brownie troop with adult woman
"Mommy, why is that man wearing a diaper?" ??\</(I/,///\
This begins as the normal conversational angle showing Annette's upper
half from behind Larry's back. During the conversation, we cut back and
forth from this pic to the following two pix as the conversation
warrants.

"Who'd have thought it? He's an animal, a dynamo! Sure, he may not look
it. But he conserves his energy all day so he can attack me...all
night!" "I only married the old coot 'cause I figured he'd die off
quickly and I'd inherit everything." Instead, "now he's shopping for
real estate in a quiet neighborhood near an elementary school!" She
wants him dead but can't do it herself. She makes an endless series of
obvious-to-the-player, but way-over-Larry's-head, transparent murder
suggestions. She continually hints at murder, mentioning many different
ways to do it, sug-gesting things, but never explicitly asking. "If only
I could find someone who would bump off the old boy for me," she thinks.
"Insurance investigators follow me everywhere," she says, paranoidally.
Of course, Larry misses her drift entirely. However, players won't, as
sub-titles reveal the true meaning of both Annette's and Larry's sides
of the conversation. (Annette's meaning is always the opposite of her
words; Larry's sub-titles are always identical to his words. In other
words, "no depth, no subtlety." )

As they negotiate, Annette tries to convince Larry to "do the dirty deed
tonight" in her stateroom. She means murder. Larry thinks sex. To "seal
the deal," Annette removes her giant hat, slips it between Larry's back
and the camera, then slides it down his back as she slides down his
front. We hear the sounds of fellatio, but see nothing but

Larry's bald spot as he arches his back. This only lasts a few seconds
(or however long it's funny) before Larry is finished. She moves back up
his body and returns the hat to head, then pulls a white hanky from the
breast pocket of her suit, daintily wipes her mouth, then tosses the
hanky out of the frame onto the floor.

She then leaves, telling Larry to "come to my room...tonight!" There's
no way offered for Larry to learn which room that is.

> Your version of the Larry theme. How about a straight-ahead jazz combo
> with tenor sax lead.

\%\
The ship's librarian, she's scholarly and erudite but sexually
repressed, her enticing eyes suppressed behind scholarly horn-rimmed
glasses, her long luxurious raven hair trapped in a stifling bun, her
ample bosoms pinned be-neath a stout corset, her creamy thighs lurking
within a conservative business suit, Vicki is a smoldering cauldron of
pent-up sexuality...until she encounters Larry. Then, her pot bubbles
over, her corset becomes a bustier, and she becomes an over-sexed sex
maniac straight out of one of her bodice-rippers, horny and aggressive.
Her voice needs a large range to contrast the quiet librarian with the
blatant slut. Intelligent, tightly-wound, inhibited, soft-spoken,
tight-kneed versus breathy, aggressive, non-subtle, steamy.

When you first meet her, she's prim and proper. On her desk she has the
classic tea set, pictures of kittens, and she wears a very conservative,
almost Victorian outfit. Larry slips a hot steamy book into her stack of
reading mate-rial. When he returns, she's (barely) dressed in leather
and the conservative decor has been replaced by all manner of strange
suggestive items.

Seems to cry out for one piece of music, played two different ways. When
she's prim and proper it could be a harpsichord/Baroque feel.
Afterwards, more of a sexy jazz alto solo.

&\'!

A Jessica Rabbit-bodied, beautiful, provocative, stereotypical James
Bond casino fly who takes these cruises only for the chance to meet men
with money -- and extract it from them. She hangs out at the casino.
Dewmi picks up Larry at the casino craps table and suggests they go to
her room to play "strip Liar's Dice." Of course, all she wants is his
recently-won cash. Furtive, sneaky, clandestine, underhanded,
surreptitious.

Dewmi's music will be heard for a long time, as it will take a while to
finish the Liar's Dice game. It should be suggestive, sexy, sultry, a
little nasty. Be careful; they'll hear a lot of this one.

(\
Mysterious, dark-haired, film noire gold-digger who married old Mr.
Boning not realizing his name referred to his sexual appetite. She's
dressed in a classy 40's black suit, with a large black floppy hat, a
mysterious woman of the night, whom Larry assumes is Boning's nurse.
Very soft-spoken, sultry, deep-voice.

Annette is our 21-year-old drop-dead gorgeous widow-maker who recently
married a 90-year-old rich guy whom she wants to bump off without
incriminating herself. She has a '40's, film noire look with a
large-brimmed black hat, black gloves, black dress, silk hose. She's a
mysterious woman who knows what she wants, knows how to get it, and
isn't afraid to do whatever it will take. Larry unwittingly kills the
old guy (by accident, of course!), but she thinks he was in on the deal.
Later on, when Larry talks with her, she thinks he's trying to blackmail
her, but he's not; he's just so clueless he doesn't know what's going
on.

Her music should be in a mystery-movie style, more serious, with
elements of mystery and danger, and should reflect her dark, sinister
personality.

&\'!

Beautiful, young, attractive, intelligent, perpetually-naked writer.
Higher voice, with a hint of Valley girl accent, young sounding. She's a
writer, historian, and avid nude sunbather. She "hangs out" at the
clothing-optional pool 24-hours-a-day wearing nothing but her laptop,
writing and catching rays. Larry actually has to talk her into wearing
clothes, so he can get her back to his room. (Now there's a twist for
ya!) Once he gets her there, she enters the shower to wash off her
SPF-300 and never comes out. To make a long story short, Larry never
gets anywhere with Drew.

Her music is mostly around the pool. The music should be fun and light
to reflect this area. Maybe a "Yellow-jackets" kind of thing. Keep it
interesting as the player hears this a lot and we don't want them to
tire of it.

,!

Beautiful, slender, former leggy super-model, Jamie Lee Coitus is a
Paris haute couture fashion designer with "a sinus infection." She has
bottles and jars everywhere filled with white powder, all with innocuous
names like "flour," "baking soda," "sugar," "perfectly legal powder,"
etc. We never mention her habit, nor does she. Small, petite voice,
excellent elocution, but not too bright.

Cool, hip, current, with-it, sexy, beautiful, rich model. Anything that
works?!

The main lobby of the ship is a large area with waterfalls and
fountains. It connects to the casino and the restau-rant. It seems like
the perfect spot for hip Musak. Soft passages will be drowned by the
waterfalls' downpour.

She's Swedish, blond, forceful, powerful, and demanding. She expects
utmost discipline, instant response to her every order, and udder
loyalty. She never grants an audience to mere passengers, merely
glancing out her cabin door's porthole. Deep Swedish accent,

You don't get to really see this woman until you think you've finished
the game...only to find out she's going to lay out yet another obstacle
for you to surmount. I hear a sexy alto solo that makes it clear Larry's
finally gonna get laid, if only he does this one more chore.

\*\
This should be the same as Captain Thygh above, but "fleshed out" (so to
speak) with the implication being Larry finally is getting laid. This
plays as our cruise ship sails off into the sunset, then over the
closing credits. A full-out, 2-minute song with solos that can be looped
if necessary.

Nailmi Jugg is the older half of the hot mother-daughter,
country-western singing babes, The Juggs ("Ya know, we're almost the
same age!"). Wrote that country classic, "Tangled Limbs and Big Hair."
Big red teased hair, loud mouth, country accent, deeper whiskey-soaked
voice.

Wydoncha Jugg is the younger half of the hot mother-daughter,
country-western singing babes, The Juggs ("Ya know, we're almost the

> They need a theme. They also need the song Larry performs with them.

This can probably be covered with the elevator Musak from the lobby, but
lowered in volume. However, when Larry talks with the Spam cutter we
should have something special to cover that. Maybe a reference to "Spam,
Spam, Spam, Spam?"

If the player changes his Windows wallpaper to
C:\\SIERRA\\LSL7\\LSLARRY7.BMP. We ship a "starter" .BMP with the game.
But during game play, every time he finishes a babe, we replace that
file with another file hidden on the CD. The effect? His Windows
wallpaper changes as he makes progress.

Use your sound card's microphone to record your favorite: expletive,
trite phrase, mad libs, obscenities. Perhaps we could do the "Almost
Live" gag: we record the gamer's own voice giving audio answers to a
series of obvious questions. Since we know full well how most people
will respond, we don't use those answers in the game to answer the
questions stated. Instead, we use the player's words as the answer in
some embarrassing and/or humorous ways.

Adding the player's own images to the game. We'll provide instructions
in how to save files in BMP format and the filenames to use. Then, if
those files exist in our patch directory, we'll display 'em in the game.

else.
