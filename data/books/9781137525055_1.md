Introduction: Video Games and Storytelling

**Video Games telling stories: A debate revisited**

Imagine being told to ‘start this mission by entering the red marker at

the Johnson House’ (GTA Net, 2015) and then as you, Carl Johnson or CJ, meet your brother Sweet, a rival gang performs an unexpected drive-by shooting and you are to ‘hop on a bicycle and follow Sweet, repeatedly tapping “X” to build up momentum’ (GTA Net, 2015). Is this a story, is it another violent episode in a soap opera or is the reader being mistaken for a member of a real-life criminal gang? The uninitiated reader will probably be having serious doubts about what is happening

in the above quote. At first sight, this extract seems to be the story of a certain gangster, Carl Johnson; if it is, then the story strangely seems to be waiting for the reader to create all the events that follow. You, the player (or reader, one could say), are suddenly thrown into some- one else’s story and are expected to continue the tale. The part about ‘repeatedly tapping “X” to build up momentum’ makes it seem even stranger: it is as if, besides all the possibilities described above, there is

also some kind of interaction with a machine. Given this hybrid sce - nario, the reader must be excused if she does not guess that this is an extract from a ‘walkthrough’, or a set of possible strategies for playing

the video game *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* (Rockstar North, 2004).

Paradoxical as this may sound, this book is about playing stories and reading games. As the extract from the *Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas* walkthrough shows, video games have begun to raise questions about their own ludicity (or ‘gamelike-ness’; *ludus* is the Latin word for ‘game’) and about whether this intrinsically involves storytelling. In simple words, this is an analysis of whether video games tell stories and if so,

of how they do this. The relevance of such discussions has increased

manifold in recent years: the Entertainment and Software Association (ESA) declares that ‘no other sector has experienced the same explosive growth as the computer and videogame industry’ (Interactive Games & Entertainment Association, 2013) and almost as if to prove them right, *Grand Theft Auto V* (Rockstar North, 2013) sales reached a billion US dol- lars in just three days – a global record. With the soaring profits and the burgeoning user-base of the video game industry, games have now attracted the attention of researchers from various disciplines the world over and issues relating to gaming culture and the gamer’s experience

have gained more relevance. Despite the increased research focus, one crucial issue – that of storytelling in video games – retains its complexity and still remains hotly debated.

The popularity and currency of the issue is clear from the fact that critics from other media have entered the discussion: a good exam - ple is the late Roger Ebert’s famous (or notorious) assertion that video

games are not art. Other celebrities from the film industry, the direc - tors Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, have commented directly on

the storytelling potential of video games. Lucas claims that the game industry is now beginning to discover how to build characters but that

‘by its very nature there cannot be a plot in a game. You can’t plot out

a football game. You can’t plot out feeding Christians to lions. It’s not a plot’ (Empire Online, 2015). For him, the story is author-driven: ‘you are leading t he au dience a long [... ] if you just let everybody go in an d do whatever they want then it’s not a story anymore [but] it’s simply a game’ (Empire Online, 2015). Spielberg, who himself has a past with gaming, feels that the bottleneck is simple: once the game-controller itself is gone, the storytelling experience will improve. He states that the game has ‘got to put the player inside the experience, where no mat - ter where you look you’re surrounded by a three-dimensional world. And that’s the future’. Will Wright, the designer of *The Sims* (Maxis, 2000) games, declared in a CNN interview that ‘games are not the right medium to tell stories’ (Millan, 2011) but conceded that they are about ‘story possibilities’.

However, gamers from all over the world think differently. In his recent book on video games, *A Mind Forever Voyagingg*, Dylan Holmes ![](Aspose.Words.304f1fcf-8d9e-4d7f-b616-94f71db4311b.001.png)comments: ‘Games are bringing something new to the table. As the

first widely adopted form of interactive media, video games have served as the testing ground for interactive storytelling techniques’ (Holmes, 2012, p. 10). Celebrity game designer and creator of the *Metal Gear* series, Hideo Kojima, has no illusions about the storytelling potential of games. He believes that ‘games are able to achieve something neither
