A Summary and Analysis of Amy Tan’s

‘Rules of the Game’

**By Dr Oliver Tearle (Loughborough University)**

‘Rules of the Game’ is one of the most popular stories which form

part of Amy Tan’s 1989 book *The Joy Luck Club*. The story is about

an eight-year-old Chinese American girl who teaches herself chess

and becomes a child prodigy, winning many national tournaments.

But ‘Rules of the Game’ is also, like many stories in *The Joy Luck*

*Club*, about a daughter’s fraught relationship with her mother.

ers,

and Molly Giles helped her to rework the story into what became

‘Rules of the Game’, the story that would become a whole series of

related stories, *The Joy Luck Club*.

Before we offer an analysis of the story, here’s a brief summary of

its plot.

**Plot summary**



<a name="br3"></a> 

The story is narrated by Waverly Place Jong, a Chinese American

woman who recounts her childhood as a young Chinese daughter

of immigrants growing up in the United States in the 1950s and

1960s. Jong is named after the street where she lived in a flat above

a Chinese bakery, but she is known as Meimei, meaning ‘Little

Sister’.

One Christmas, the children are given some presents, and Meimei’s

brother Vincent is given a chess set with a couple of pieces missing.

He and their brother Winston start learning the game. Initially,

Vincent refuses to let his sister join them, but when she gives him

some of her sweets (which were *her* Christmas present) to use as

the missing chess pieces, he allows her, and the sweets (called Life

Savers) are allowed to be kept and eaten by the player who wins or

captures them.

When he explains the rules of a chess game to her, she asks

questions about it. She goes away and researches how the game

works. She learns that one must always have a sense of the

endgame when one begins playing a game, and that chess is a

‘game of secrets’ in which one must ‘show’ rather than ‘tell’.



<a name="br4"></a> 

Her brothers quickly lose interest in the game, but Meimei remains

fascinated by it. She plays an old Chinese man in the

neighbourhood, and loses many times. This man, Lau Po, teaches

Meimei some of the secrets of the game, and she improves. She

enters chess tournaments and wins many games, bringing home

many trophies. By the time she turns nine years old, she’s a national

chess champion and a child prodigy.

However, Meimei dislikes the way her mother parades her around

in town and shows off her famous daughter. Meimei confronts her

about this, telling her mother that if she wants to show off, she

should learn to play chess herself. When her mother grows angry at

this, Meimei runs away through the streets.

When she returns home, her mother blanks her and turns the whole

family against her. The story ends with Meimei viewing her mother

as her adversary, as though they are playing a vast game of chess

against each other, and Meimei dreams of floating out of the

window and escaping.

**Analysis**



<a name="br5"></a> 

Tan’s title, ‘Rules of the Game’, is cleverly double-edged, ostensibly

referring to the ‘game’ of chess and its rules (which are explained

by Vincent when Meimei first begins playing it), but also suggesting

the ‘game of life’. By the end of the story, with Meimei plotting her

next ‘move’ against her mother, the extended metaphor which runs

through the story – chess as a metaphor for life itself – reaches a

crescendo.

Yet it is clear that Meimei possesses a certain naivety regarding the

game of life: she may have a much clearer understanding of chess

than her mother, but her mother has considerably more experience

of the other ‘game’. Look at how Meimei, at the end of the story,

casts her mother as the player with the black chess pieces: she is

white (goodness, purity) while her mother is black (evil).

But although Meimei doesn’t realise it, her mother has taught her,

yet again, the importance of ‘invisible strength’ – a lesson which,

the opening lines of the story tell us, she had first learned from her

mother when she was six years old.



<a name="br6"></a> 

parade her celebrated daughter around and show her off. That’s the

very opposite of ‘invisible’ strength. There’s a sense that she wants

her children not to have to be invisible in the first place, but to be

visible, successful, and integrated into American society through

their successful pursuit of ‘the American dream’.

But through doing insisting on showing off her daughter, she

inadvertently ends up imparting another valuable lesson to Meimei.

And of course, the ‘game of life’ played by both Meimei and her

mother is a race game, of sorts: as Chinese Americans, they can

blend in and be ignored or overlooked by others (much as the

white American whom Meimei faces, and beats, in her first

tournament underestimates his younger, female, Chinese

opponent), and with this ‘invisibility’ comes a certain power.

Tan weaves examples of this power of invisibility through ‘Rules of

the Game’. Meimei recounts the time when a white tourist

persuaded her and other Chinese children to pose outside a

Chinese restaurant with a roast duck in shot in the window behind

them.



<a name="br7"></a> 

Resenting this act of cultural stereotyping, Meimei spins the tourist

a horror story about the kind of ghastly food the restaurant serves

up (which includes octopus gizzards) in order to shock and appal

him. The tourist, who clearly wasn’t expecting such a response from

a little Chinese girl, is suitably horrified.

**The question of identity**

And although ‘Rules of the Game’ is about the conflict between two

different generations of Chinese women from the same family –

much as another of the stories from *The Joy Luck Club*, ‘[Two](https://interestingliterature.com/2022/03/amy-tan-two-kinds-summary-analysis/)[ ](https://interestingliterature.com/2022/03/amy-tan-two-kinds-summary-analysis/)[Kinds](https://interestingliterature.com/2022/03/amy-tan-two-kinds-summary-analysis/)’,

is – it is also about the clash between Chinese and American, and

the hybrid identity which Homi K. Bhabha and other theorists have

drawn attention to among immigrant peoples.

Meimei’s mother tells her daughter that the ‘American rules’ which

govern the children’s chess set require her daughter to find out

how to master those rules herself: going to a new country requires

learning a whole new set of rules, laws, and codes.



<a name="br8"></a> 

It is significant that when Meimei goes to visit the ‘Santa man’ who

gives the children their Christmas presents, she is aware of her two

different ages: she is seven years old according to the ‘American

formula’ but eight years old in the Chinese calendar. Even the ‘rules’

governing her age are different.
