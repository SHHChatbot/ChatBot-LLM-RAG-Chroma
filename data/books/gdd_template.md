Mansion of Doom GDD V1.0

This is a template for a Game Design Document (GDD). As it's a template
there are many elements that may not apply to your game, (if it's a
fighting game or a puzzle-focused game). This is a starting point based
on the games I've talked about in the book.

This document is a '*scope'* document, it outlines the main areas of the
game and what making the game will entail for the developers. It's a
blueprint for the game and will adapt and change over time ("we can't
get the cooperative component to work right, let's drop that in favor of
a more solid one-player experience" etc.)\
There is no perfect GDD or Design document, as long as all the
stakeholders (those involved in the design, publication and promotion of
the game) can make sense of it and use it to understand their workload
and who's doing what, that's good enough.

**Game Design Document:**\
**Cover**: Logo/Image. As with the Design Document Example. Always good
to have some exciting cover art.

**Title:** Awesome Name Here (check the name or a similar one is not
already in use). **Version**: (your team needs to know if the document
has been updated and that they're looking at the most up-to-date copy).

**Written By and Contact Details**: who is the document's author (Art
director?

Producer? )\
**Header/Footer**; each page should have the game title at the top and a
version number. The footer should contain copyright information, page
numbering and a date.

**Overview:** is this is an original game or a licensed property? If
it's licensed how does the game fit with the licensor's directives and
expectations (Would Batman ever be able to kill an enemy)?

**List of Document Contents**: (needs to be updated along with changes)
**Team Roles:** List the roles and titles of everyone working on the
project.

**Revision/Editorial:** Using a product such as a google Doc or
Microsoft Word, turn revision tracking on so that others can see who has
made changes and what they are.

The main editor/owner can accept/decline these changes in meetings with
the other team members.

**Game Objectives:** List USPs (unique selling points) of the game in an
'elevator pitch' (something short) short-praragraph style. Think about
what features of your game would be on the back of a retail box or
mentioned in a review.

> **Genre**: Action, Adventure, Action/Adventure etc. If the game is not
> easily classified in a genre you can create one, but know that this
> can be confusing for others (e.g. 'exploration/walking' games as a
> genre did not really exist until advent of Gone Home, Proteus etc.).
>
> **The Big Idea:** What is the overall "bird's eye view" of the game?
> Give a short description of the main elements of your game "quest for
> revenge/power or romance/realtionships" etc.
>
> o Target Audience & expected ESRB/PEGI rating.
>
> o Game storyline/narrative or focus -- what is the game about? o
> USPs/hooks -- why would people play this game?

**Platform**: What platforms is this game to be played on? Remember that
certain platforms have quality control and licensing requirements and/or
costs (for example Microsoft require that developers have errors and
omissions insurance which can be several thousand dollars).

> *To release on a console you have to pay a hardware license and if the
> game is for multiple international markets the game has to be
> submitted to foreign ratings boards which also is an expense.*

**Technical Requirements:** Will the game have multiplayer, cooperative
play, uploading and downloading items, a store etc.?

> o Gameplay type descriptions: Stealth, driving, simulation. MoBA etc.

**Story/Narrative:** This can be short as the game hasn't been written
yet, focus on the context of gameplay ('you are an assassin who can
climb towers").

> o How does the player start the game? *(Tutorial? Jump straight in?)*\
> o List of locations and relationship to the game concept *(different
> planets mean* *players can access different resources etc.)*\
> o How does the player get from one location to the next? *(Fast
> Travel? Maps?)* o What is the ending and who or what is the player by
> the end of the game?
>
> *(Saved world/become super soldier/married soulmate etc.)*

**Exposition**: Are there cut-scenes? Are they skippable or QTEs
(Interactive Quick Time Events)?

**Controls:** Diagram of the control scheme and control mapping for all
platforms. List known controls of player movement

**Technology requirements:** This is an overview for the design team, in
larger, more complex games there is usually a Technical Design Document
(TDD) which gets into details only programmers and software engineers
love.

o What game engine tools will this game use and what need to be built?

> o What is the implementation of the camera, game physics,
> enemies/bosses, and so on? And who is being tasked with the
> implementation? (Programmers, animators, graphic designers).
>
> o What is going to be created in-house and what is going to be bought
> in (physics engines, ragdolls, scripting etc.)?
>
> o What are the developer tools for Quality Assurance testing and
> 'cheat modes' for developer and testers?
>
> o What do you expect the PC specifications to be?

**Camera**: List camera types, (first person, third person, scrolling,
locked etc.)

> o List occurrences where a unique camera may be used (for example the
> locked camera used in conversations by Bethesda games).

**User Interface** (HUDs etc.): list or show how game information is
visualized for the player.

> o Include images of health, alignment, power, ammunition, money,
> count-\
> downs/cool-downs, maps, relevant cockpit information, lives, weapon
> targeting and any special modes such as Batman's "Detective Vision" or
> slow-motion (Max Payne series).

**Wireframe Player Screens.**

Create a sketch or use wireframing tools to show interactions points
between screens and navigation like you would when designing a website.
Show connectivity between all game screens.

**High Level Player Interface:**

**Title Screen, Start Screen & Idle**: What do you want the player's
first impression to be of the game? What happens when they hit 'play'
and what happens if they leave the game alone?

> o List or title/start screen and storyboard any animation and
> graphics. o Detail what selection options are available to the player
> such as "new Game/Save/load game".
>
> o Are there naming conventions for game saves? Are they customizable?

**Credentials:** List what credit screens need to be shown when the game
is booting up. What *must* be shown? (Publisher logo, Licensors,
Third-party software manufacturers) *To see this start playing any game
on any console and you'll see a list of credentials.*

**The Option Screen**: This can be multiple screens or just one
depending on the platform and design choices of the game. PC games can
get very advanced just on graphics and control settings.

> o Game Option:\
> • Video (brightness/contrast, aspect ratio etc.)

• Audio (environment audio levels, subtitles, speech etc.)

> • Music (levels and customization)\
> • Control settings (alternative layouts rumble on/off)

**Loading screens**: Is there a loading screen (possibly hiding asset
loading/game engine booting up) and what does it look like? Does it
showcase beautifully rendered game assets (models of weapons, characters
etc.) or give insight into the story or world?

*(NAMCO had a patent on games being played in loading screens, until Nov
2015 no developer could have mini-games in their loading screens.)*

**Keeping Score**: does the game have any rating system for the player
such as a high score system? What is the use and/or value of a scoring
system? Is it cashed in for equipment, better combat options or just for
'bragging rights'?

**High Score/Leaderboard**: If the game has one, what doe it look like?
Is it only in the multiplayer mode or all player modes? Are player stats
being tracked and displayed?

**Game Overview.**

**Core Game Mechanics:** Detail all 'core' (most often used, non-special
move etc.) mechanics that are used in the game.

> o List interactive items (handles, platforms, boxes etc.)

**World overview:** Create a 'map' (wireframe or storyboard) of all game
locations and where they interconnect or stack.

> o Audio- note any areas that require specific sound effects or music
> (i.e.
>
> different levels might be towns with a different music background,
> dark tunnel levels have very different sound effects).

**The Levels:** Create a detailed list of each of the games levels. Even
an open-world game has levels or areas (underground caves, mountaintop
villages, disused shelters).
