Ab(Sense) of an Ending: Telos and Time in Video Game Narratives

**Game over: When does the story stop?**

The plots of the video game narrative(s) are a great deal more complicated than the mesh of stories created in Calvino’s *The Castle of Crossed Destinies*. The structural constraints seen in the codex form are present in a lesser degree: unlike the apparently linear plots of earlier narrative media, the story-space in digital games is seemingly endless

or multitelic. For some commentators, this poses major problems in conceiving of them as narratives. Often, unlike in older media, the game-text’s ending does not correspond to the spatial and the tem- poral limits of the game. Time operates in a complicated manner in the game-text and the replayability of the text gives rise to different narratives; yet, as any gamer knows, the ‘different’ narratives may be extremely repetitive with scarcely any variant feature to mark them out. A number of studies on ‘reading’ (or (w)reading) video games refer to their multiple endings as a unique feature but none attempt in-depth analysis. However, as this peculiar nature of the endings is a significant factor in compounding the problem with ‘reading’ digital game-texts as

a narrative medium, a discussion of this is now long overdue.

This chapter will analyse the telic possibilities of game-texts and in the process explore the link between the latter and other forms of texts. It will concentrate on the key problem of difference and repe- tition and will move on to address various related positions in game studies, especially Juul’s work on time in games and Bogost’s concept of game events as ‘unit operations’. Increasingly, game studies scholars are looking beyond the narrow domain of the Ludology–Narratology debate and beginning to draw on key concepts from various other dis - ciplines. Bogost’s *Unit Operations* (Bogost, 2008), which draws upon the current theoretical concepts of Deleuze and Alain Badiou, is a case in

point. Although Bogost does not directly discuss the telic character - istics of game-texts, his discussion of game events as being discrete ‘unit operations’ is linked to Badiou’s response to the ideas on differ- ence and repetition in Deleuze. However, while agreeing that Bogost’s argument operates on a much more theoretically sophisticated level in terms of video game criticism, this chapter will also illustrate certain dis - tinct disadvantages involved in following Badiou’s response, especially

in relation to the way in which notions of time work within video games and how they influence the *telos* in game-texts. It will, therefore, develop on the Deleuzoguattarian framework of analysis that was introduced in the opening chapters. Such an analysis of the *telos* in the video game - assemblage will also open up the possibilities of exploring the multitelic nature of other forms of narrative media, like stories in the codex form.

Endings have always been a major element of interest in the world of stories. Scheherazade famously preserves her life by postponing the end of her story and weaving within it a mesh of stories. Shakespeare’s endings have long baffled generations of scholars. Sometimes, later Shakespearean productions have even changed the endings: for exam - ple, Nahum Tate’s nineteenth-century *King Lear*, which had a happy ![](Aspose.Words.6c289ffc-3eb8-4b63-a507-eb0d4376b3b3.001.png)ending in which Cordelia is married to Edgar, in stark contrast to Shakespeare’s original conclusion. More recently, especially in works like Calvino’s *The Castle of Crossed Destinies* or Alain Robbe-Grillet’s novels,

the literary narrative contains many endings and repetitions because of which conceptions of temporality and *telos* are altered and confused. The problem of endings in these works points clearly to the fact that narrative endings have always had the potential of multiplicity, whether on the level of text, continuation of story or interpretation.

The multiplicity of endings in the game-texts is not a unique media-specific feature and is already present in earlier narrative media. Although narratives in game-texts may employ different technologies, they are essentially not *new*. A major claim that the advocates of this so-called ‘newness’ make is that of replayability. For commentators like Juul or Lindley, the repetition characteristic to video games is largely incom patible with narrative. Juul states that ‘Literar y qualities [ ... ] actu - ally make videogames less repeatable’ (Juul, 1999) while Lindley claims

that the repetitive structure of videogames undermines any strong sense of narrative development’ (Lindley, 2002). However, these claims are based on older conceptions of narrative progression such as the lin -

ear structure of Aristotelian drama; they cannot be justified under more recent conceptions of narrativity, as examples throughout this chapter will illustrate.
