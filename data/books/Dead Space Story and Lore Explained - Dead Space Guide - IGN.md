With our introduction to the universe taking place hundreds of years after the ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.006.png)canonical beginning of the overall Dead Space timeline, there are many concepts in

It's worth noting that a lot of Dead Space's story is explained via audio ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.014.png)![ref1]and text logs.

<a name="_page2_x108.49_y213.79"></a>Dead Space's Story Explained

Our tale takes place in the year 2508 aboard the USG Ishimura; an elite spaceship known as a "planet cracker" that has the ability to mine planets. In Dead Space's dystopian far future, humanity has exhausted Earth's natural resources, creating ships like the Ishimura to harvest other planets for their resources.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.015.png)

However, this seemingly routine planet-cracking mission appears to have met a hitch, and that's where we come in. Receiving a distress beacon from the USG Ishimura, engineer Isaac Clarke (our lead protagonist), Senior Security Officer Zach Hammond, Computer Specialist Kendra Daniels, Corporal Johnston and Corporal Aiden Chen are sent to board the ship and discover the source of the distress call. Isaac has additional skin in the game as his wife, Doctor Nicole Brennan, is stationed aboard the ship, working on a mysterious project.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.016.png)

The responding officers arrive at the mining ship but, due to a malfunction, crash their vessel into the Ishimura's docking bay. They're surprised to find nobody responds to their extravagant entrance, and it doesn't take long to deduce why. After investigating the vessel, Isaac, Hammond, Daniels and Chen are attacked by nightmarish monsters known as necromorphs. In their first encounter with the creatures, Chen is killed and Isaac is separated from his allies, fleeing deeper into the ship.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.017.png)

After escaping an initial swarm of necromorphs, Isaac finds a small workshop where he ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.018.png)![ref1]tracks down a Plasma Cutter and a message scrawled in blood on a wall: "Cut off their limbs". Isaac realises that the flesh-eating creatures (which appear to be mutated versions of the ship's crew) can only be stopped if they're dismembered, giving our protagonist a means to defeat this mysterious foe. With this knowledge, Isaac pushes on, determined to find his wife Nicole, reunite with his crew and depart the ship.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.019.png)

After managing to re-establish contact with Hammond and Daniels, the trio summarize

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.020.png)

From here, Isaac journeys through the ship, fixing its systems and attempting to learn ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.021.png)![ref1]more about the necromorphs. Eventually, Isaac discovers that the planet the ship's orbiting and mining, Aegis VII, has been quarantined for centuries. The Ishimura's crew were aware of this, but opted to travel to it regardless, with Isaac realising that their true goal wasn't to mine the planet but instead retrieve an ancient extraterrestrial artifact known as a Red Marker.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.022.png)

While heading through Medical, Engines and eventually the Bridge, Isaac learns that the ship's Captain, Benjamin Mathius, was a devout believer in the Church of Unitology; a religious group that worships a sacred artifact known as The Black Marker. Said to have otherwordly properties, the Unitologists believe the marker holds the secrets to eternal life and rebirth, so when the colonists on Aegis VII seemingly found another marker, they sent Benjamin Mathius and the Ishimura on a mission to retrieve it under the guise of a standard mining job.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.023.png)

While learning this, Isaac reunites with Hammond, who is currently on the Bridge attempting to stop the ship from crashing into an oncoming asteroid field. Hammond also reveals that he was attacked by a necromorph version of Chen, who he's locked in an escape pod. Isaac reminds Hammond that it's not Chen anymore, and he jettisons the creature out into space (this will be important later on).

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.024.png)

Isaac manages to recalibrate the ADS cannons outside the ship and prevents the Ishimura from being destroyed by asteroids, although he receives a mysterious signal from Nicole in Medical and decides to investigate. Along the way, he discovers additional details about the Ishimura's retrieval of the marker, including the fact that Mathius managed to convert many scientists and researchers aboard the craft to Unitology.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.025.png)

He also learns that the marker was driving those around it to madness, giving them extreme![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.026.png)![ref1] paranoia, severe depression, vivid hallucinations and intrusive thoughts that were causing them to grow violent. The effects were first surveyed in the Aegis VII colony but eventually made their way to the Ishimura once the Red Marker had been transported to the ship. However, things really went south after the Ishimura began mining Aegis VII.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.027.png)

After the Ishimura blew a huge crater in the planet, the colony down on Aegis VII were attacked and infected by a horde of necromorphs. As the monsters flooded the colony, they begged for help from the Ishimura, which closed off all contact in an effort to prevent the infection from spreading. This was Mathius' decision, which was questioned heavily by the Ishimura's crew. Eventually, in a bid to save the colony, Doctor Terrence Kyne attempted to arrest Matthius. However, Kyne accidentally killed the Captain while trying to sedate him. The necromorphs then made their way to the Ishimura via a shuttle from Aegis VII that managed to board the ship.

Back to Isaac's journey, the down-on-his-luck engineer enters Medical and tracks ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.029.png)![ref1]Nicole's signal to a laboratory housing a mysterious creature. Before Isaac can investigate, he's captured by a malicious scientist named Challus Mercer. Mercer has clearly been driven mad by the marker, telling Isaac to worship it and repeatedly mentioning an event known as "Convergence".

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.030.png)

He's also been experimenting on the necromorphs, creating a nigh-on unkillable abomination he calls "The Hunter", which has the ability to regenerate dismembered limbs. Although Mercer attempts to kill Isaac with the creature, he escapes, although the beast still stalks him through Medical as he attempts to deal with poisonous gas filling the ship. Isaac eventually defeats the monster by freezing it, although he hasn't had his last run-in with Mercer's regenerating henchmen just yet...

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.031.png)

After his confrontation with Mercer, Isaac heads to Hydroponics, where he and a fellow survivor named Doctor Cross stop the poisonous gas and eject a giant monster known as The Leviathan out into space. During this time, Isaac discovers that, if he fixes communications, he could send an SOS call out into space. Deciding to pursue this goal, he heads down to the mining sector.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.032.png)

There, he finds his wife Nicole Brennan, who seems to be alive and well if not acting unnaturally. She's happy to see Isaac and assists him, although the two are forced to take separate paths. Elated that his wife is alive, Isaac returns to his mission, attaching the communication array to a meteor and jettisoning it out into space.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.033.png)

With the communication array in place, he heads to the bridge to activate it, although ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.034.png)![ref1]he realises that The Leviathan has clung onto the ship and he'll have to remove it manually. Fighting the monster again, he defeats it for good and activates communications, managing to get in touch with a ship known as the USM Valor. It seems rescue is on its way, until the soldiers aboard the Valor confirm that they've picked up the Ishimura's escape pod... the exact same escape pod containing necromorph Corporal Chen that Hammond jettisoned into space earlier in the game.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.035.png)

Moments later, the Valor crashes into the Ishimura and, after investigating, Isaac finds all the crew dead with freshly turned necromorphs in their place. Determined to find some shred of hope in the situation, Isaac and Hammond separately venture through the craft and find a Singularity Core, which they take, although Hammond is killed by necromorph Chen while retrieving it.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.036.png)

Returning to the ship, Isaac makes his final push, heading down to the Crew Quarters in hopes of finding a shuttle he can insert the Singularity Core into. While down there, he comes face to face with Mercer and the red marker. After another run-in with Mercer's hunter, Isaac escapes, eventually meeting Doctor Terrance Kyne. Kyne has clearly been influenced by the marker, however, he begs Isaac for his help. He reveals that, down on Aegis VII, the Ishimura's mining efforts unveiled a gargantuan monster ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.037.png)![ref1]known as the Hive Mind.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.038.png)

It appears the Hive Mind is behind the necromorph outbreak, but, if the red marker was taken back down to Aegis VII, it could be used to seal the monster away. Isaac is wary but agrees to help Kyne take the marker down to the planet, hoping to end things once and for all. Isaac loads the marker onto the escape shuttle, encountering Mercer moments before he's brutally killed by a large tentacle.

<a name="_page8_x108.49_y241.29"></a>Dead Space Ending Explained

After dealing with Mercer and his necromorphs, Isaac successfully loads the marker onto the shuttle and returns to the docking bay where he intends to fly down to Aegis VII with Kyne, Daniels and Nicole.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.039.png)

However, when he arrives, Daniels murders Kyne and flies out of the hangar with the marker, revealing to Isaac that she's been working for the government all along. It turns out Daniels was tasked with retrieving the marker from the Ishimura, with her employers wanting to cover up its existence.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.040.png)

ADVERTISEMENT

According to Daniels, the red marker was actually built by humans and is a direct ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.041.png)![ref1]copy of the black marker found on earth hundreds of years prior. Back when humanity discovered the first marker, they realised the artifacts had otherworldly properties worth studying, so they made copies and shipped them off to other planets for experiments. This is why Aegis VII was under quarantine.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.042.png)

The government eventually caught wind of the Unitologists attempt to retrieve the marker from Aegis VII and decided to prevent their efforts. The USM Valor (the ship that was intercepted by necromorph Chen) was supposed to assist Daniels in this effort, helping her extract the marker from the ship. After learning all of this, Isaac is initially abandoned on the Ishimura to die. However, Nicole contacts Isaac, telling him to meet her in the hangar.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.043.png)

In a strange sequence of events where Isaac drifts in and out of consciousness, he and Nicole recall Daniels' ship to the docking bay, forcing her to eject down to the planet's surface in an escape pod. Isaac and Nicole then board the ship and then fly down to Aegis VII together, preparing the red marker and getting ready to seal the Hive Mind away.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.044.png)

However, as the two get the marker into position, it fires a beam of red energy into the sky. Soon after, Nicole begins to rant to Isaac about how he's "making us whole again" and beginning "convergence". Realising that the marker isn't sealing the Hive Mind ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.045.png)![ref1]away as intended, Isaac attempts to remove the tethers around the crater housing the monster.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.046.png)

While removing the tethers, he runs into Daniels, who takes Nicole hostage. Daniels tells Isaac he's been corrupted by the marker's influence, showing him a video message that reveals the truth: Nicole died long before Isaac arrived on the Ishimura. This new Nicole is an illusion. The marker has been using Isaac as a puppet, projecting Nicole's form over Doctor Cross; the scientist Isaac helped in Hydroponics. Realising it's too late to stop the marker, Daniels shoots Cross and then flees the scene, attempting to hijack the shuttle Isaac took to the surface.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.047.png)

Realising he's been controlled, Isaac races Daniels back to the ship but is intercepted by The Hive Mind, which murders Daniels and traps Isaac. In a hard-fought battle, Isaac defeats the Hive Mind and flies the shuttle into space. After sitting in silence for a few seconds, he turns to look in the passenger seat and sees a dead version of Nicole staring back at him. It stares for a few seconds before attacking.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.048.png)

Although Isaac does defeat the Hive Mind and escape, the damage has been done. The marker has corrupted Isaac's mind, driving him insane. As we learn in Dead Space 2, he'll never recover from its effects.

Dead Space's Alternate Ending Explained![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.049.png)![ref1]

Although a standard playthrough will net you Dead Space's classic ending, playing through New Game Plus and collecting all of the newly added will unlock an alternate finale. It's worth also briefly explaining this conclusion as it leaves a lot of questions, especially for newcomers to the series.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.050.png)

In this conclusion, everything remains identical until Isaac defeats the Hive Mind and uses the executive shuttle to escape into space. Usually, this is when Isaac is attacked by an undead hallucination of Nicole, however, our new conclusion sees him fully embrace the marker's effects on him. In this ending, Isaac speaks lovingly to the marker-induced hallucination of his dead wife, telling her that he intends to make something for her, although he refrains from revealing exactly what it is.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.051.png)

This is seemingly a reference to Dead Space 2, with Isaac teasing his plans to build the Red Marker. As we find out during the sequel, in the time between Dead Space 1 and Dead Space 2, the Marker's influence drives Isaac to build a replica of the Red Marker found on Aegis VII. Isaac builds this new Red Marker with the help of Earth's shady government and a fellow marker-influenced patient named Nolan Stross. It's then contained on a government-owned space station known as The Sprawl, with its effects eventually causing the site to be overrun by necromorphs, leading to the events of the second game.

Although the summary above will provide an overview of the story and the events leading up to it, let's quickly address some other lore that's never fully referenced in the narrative but adds additional context to its main beats.

<a name="_page12_x108.49_y157.45"></a>Church of Unitology

So, what exactly is the Church of Unitology? Well, in Dead Space lore, Unitology ties heavily in with the discovery of the Black Marker on Earth nearly 300 years before the events of the first game. This was the first marker encountered by humanity, and was located in the Chicxulub crater in Mexico. The investigation of the Black Marker was the subject of the book Dead Space: Martyr, with the story following Doctor Michael Altman, who was one of the first humans to interact with the marker.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.053.png)

ADVERTISEMENT

If Altman's name seems familiar, it's because he's one of Dead Space's most important characters. The Unitologists will frequently reference Altman as a divine prophet of the religion, going as far as to bid each other farewell by saying "Praise Altman." Altman is a holy figure to the Unitologists, although this was not the ill-fated scientist's original intention. After first interacting with the marker, most of Altman's colleagues and friends lost their lives after being driven mad by the artifact. Altman, on the other hand, was resistant to its effects.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.054.png)

Realising how dangerous his discovery was, Altman warned the world about the Black ![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.055.png)![ref1]Marker, revealing its existence to the public. After destroying the facility housing the marker, Altman was captured and murdered by a group of military officers under the marker's influence. These officers formed the Church of Unitology shortly after, lying about Altman's murder and twisting it so he became a martyr. They claim Altman was spoken to by the marker and died to share its divine wisdom with the world.

![](Aspose.Words.8d2f4fa5-ca24-4b6f-be8c-4aa3f3e29ad5.056.png)

ADVERTISEMENT

In the years since Altman's death, the Church of Unitology grows into a widely shared religion, although it seems it's seen as more of a cult. Their core beliefs are that the marker has infinite wisdom, will reunite them with loved ones that have passed away and bring rebirth after death. Isaac even reveals during the 2023 Dead Space Remake that his mother was a Unitologist, although the church corrupted her mind, eventually leading to her death.

<a name="_page13_x108.49_y594.75"></a>Convergence and The Truth Behind The Markers

Whether it's Doctor Mercer or Isaac's hallucination of Nicole, you'll no doubt remember the word "convergence" being mentioned a fair few times. While at this point in the story, the true nature of convergence isn't supposed to be entirely clear, Dead Space 3 does eventually reveal what convergence is and the true purpose of the marker.
