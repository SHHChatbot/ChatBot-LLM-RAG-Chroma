Shapeshifting Stories: Reading Video Game Stories through Paratexts

**Reading the ephemeral text**

Will it ever be possible to ‘read’ games as the previous chapter seems to suggest? How does one read a text that keeps changing and indeed, what *is* the text of a video game that is being played again and again by many players? In *Literary Gamingg*, Astrid Ensslin, writing as recently as ![](Aspose.Words.355ff4fb-b4b2-4f68-84f5-96ba6956501a.001.png)2014, takes on the analysis of what she calls ‘hybrid literary-ludic arte - facts’ (Ensslin, 2014, p. 38). In her conclusion, she points to possible projects, one of which is ‘to examine literary gaming from the user’s perspective, applying methods of empirical reader-response, audience, and player’ and also to look at ‘the creators of literary-ludic artefacts and studying their creative agendas and processes.’ As seen in the previ- ous chapter, the analysis of storytelling in video games needs to reflect the originary supplementarity between the literary and the ludic; as such this book extends its scope beyond any specific category that can be called ‘hybrid literary-ludic artefacts’. Ensslin’s conclusion, however, points at some key interventions that are necessary in the field. The story that unfolds in the experience of playing a video game varies from player to player, of course depending on the game itself. This is the challenge that *The Stanley Parable* throws at its players/readers and the Prince of Persia in *The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time* reiterates in his attempt to negate the player’s death, ‘No no no, that’s not how it happened – do you want to hear my story?’ The complex multitelic experience described here will be addressed in the following chapter; this one will attempt to understand whether the ephemeral text, which the player plays out and changes with each gameplay, can be analysed

at all.

It is here that a discussion of paratexts is needed. The so-called ‘disap - pearing’ game narrative may be configurative but it is also experiential and although the actual instance of the game might not be available again, the narrative is nevertheless recorded in diverse ways such as player diaries, After Action Reports, ‘Let’s Play’ video recordings and

a series of related sources such as reviews, previews, message-board posts, screenshots and trailers. These are referred to here onwards as the paratexts. Mia Consalvo’s book, *Cheating: Gaining Advantage in Videogames* (Consalvo, 2009), was instrumental in bringing the rele - vance of paratextual material in video games to the forefront and the topic has seen extensive discussion since.

By the standards determined from earlier notions of storytelling, video games might seem an anomaly given the experiential and at the same time, ephemeral nature of the game-narrative. To dismiss the video game-narrative thus is, however, to ignore an essential element in the experience of the video game-story: the paratext. It will be argued here that the paratext is not the ‘new’story but that it always was intrinsically part of storytelling. Speaking in a similar vein, Digital media theorist, Peter Lunenfeld, ar gues that the ‘backstor y [ ... ] is fast becomin g almost as important as the original thing itself’ (Lunenfeld, 2000, p. 11). Using

the example of video game paratext, the latest entrant into the dialogues around textuality and narratives, this chapter will attempt to position video games within an understanding of literature and in doing so, will re-examine the idea of the literary itself in terms of how texts that are characterised by such multiplicity can be better comprehended.

Consalvo and Lunenfeld both derive their concept of ‘paratext’ from Gerard Genette. Genette describes the ‘number of verbal and other pro - ductions’ such as the author’s name, the preface and illustrations that ‘surround or extend’ a book as the ‘paratext’: ‘accordingly, the paratext is what enables a text to become a book and to be offered as such to its readers and, more generally, to the public. More than a boundary or a sealed border the paratext is a *threshold*’ (Genette, 1997a, p. 1, orig - inal emphasis). Among later examples of the concept in video game criticism, Genette’s ‘Structuralist insistence that there be an interior and exterior to the text’ has been disagreed with; likewise, his defini-

tion of the text as verbal statements has been seen to indicate that he intended his concept of paratexts for books only and therefore, ques- tions have been raised as to whether his concept also works for digital media. Genette, however, seems well aware of other media beyond the printed book and although he restricts his own comments to the paratexts of the printed book, in *Palimpsests* (Genette, 1997) he refers
