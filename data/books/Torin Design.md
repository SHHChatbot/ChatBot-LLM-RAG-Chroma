·  fun and funny, suitable for all ages; if parent plays with kids, both enjoy but at different levels 

·  examples to emulate: *Lion King, Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast, ET, Mrs. Doubtfire* ·  “in the style of *King’s Quest,*” but with humor 

·  humor comes from humorous situations, not cheap sit-com put-down laughs 

·  utilize magic, magical creatures, or advanced technologies 

·  target audience has CD, sound card, fast machine & wants a game that shows it off 

·  keep broad market in mind; think bigger than KQ 

·  has strong central characters with well-developed, well-rounded personalities 

·  sticks to universally recognized situations, characters, emotions 

·  plan for sequels 

·  uses 2-D animation (not video, not 3-D SGI-look) for Disney look & feel 

·  follows Disney customs: 

  

1. Character definitions are crystal clear. You always know who’s what. People look exactly like what they are: bad people look evil and wear black. The hero looks good and wears light colors. His girl is the prettiest girl. 
1. Someone clearly expresses the protagonist’s personality, the story’s dilemma plus its probable solution within the first few minutes; often via song. 
1. The protagonist is never the comic. We laugh WITH the hero, never at him. 
1. There’s at least one goofy sidekick for laughs. 
1. Modern language, slang, sarcasm, 20th-century references, and gags are okay, but only from the comic relief sidekicks. 
1. Double entendres are okay, but they must be over the kids’ heads. 
1. Specifically tell the audience the emotion they should presently feel by regularly showing them the protagonist’s friends expressing it. 
1. The weather constantly changes to express the story’s current emotion. 
1. Include cute characters doing cute things to make people go, “Awhh!” (i.e., Chip the cup; Abu; Tiger & Sultan) Somehow, the cute character helps save the day. 
1. Include a family member so the protagonist can express family love. 
1. Include a really bad guy so the protagonist has someone to overcome. 
1. Even inanimate objects are drawn with personality and look like they might spring to life at any moment. 
1. Work basic human values into the plot: 
1. hunger, sympathy (Aladdin steals bread, then gives to homeless kids) 
1. romantic love (Beauty for Beast; Aladdin for Jasmine; Ariel for Prince) 
1. familial love (Beauty for Father; Neptune for Ariel) 
1. freedom (Jasmine wants to be free from the palace; Ariel from the ocean; Beast from his spell; Beauty from her provincial life) 
1. honor, faithfulness (Aladdin promised to free Genie, so he must, even though he thinks it will cost him everything he wants; Beauty gives herself to Beast in trade for her father’s freedom) 
1. justice (bad guys must always lose by the end) 
1. self-worth (Aladdin, Jasmine, Beast) 
1. you are what’s within you (Aladdin; Gaston is classically handsome hero, yet he’s a beast inside)

Strata is a planet without a molten core, consisting of layers of surfaces, worlds nested inside one another like so many Russian mamushka dolls. Each level has its own distinctive feel, style, ecosystems, inhabitants, weather pat- terns, etc. The planet’s layers of worlds is depicted on the game’s Chapter interface screen and reflected in the Hol- lywood Bowl-like auditorium in the game’s final level. 

The surface world, where the game begins, is known as “The Land Above” to its inhabitants. It is the only home our hero has ever known and its woodsy hills will feel familiar and Earth-like. His descent into “The Lands Below” reveals fantastic landscapes, unique plants, and foreign people and unusual animals. Eventually reaching the planet’s core, he encounters gravity nulls producing a fun zero-gravity scene inside the planet’s hollow core. The lack of pe- troleum and some minerals common to Earth have prevented mechanical and combustion-driven technology, but the technology they do have is so highly advanced as to seem magical to human eyes. 

On Strata, even non-humans have human-like speech. Some characters appear to be animals, although certainly no animal you’ve seen before. Animals talk, plants walk, crystal strata are used as highways…in short, in Torin’s Passage, anything is possible. 

- . / & 

 

The surface world is near-perfect: temperate shirt-sleeve comfortable year-round. The buildings don’t need win- dows, just openings to let in the fresh breezes. Evenings are cool but never cold, days are warm but never hot. (Pic- ture equatorial coastal cities.) Streams, lakes, forests…all seem familiar, yet just a little strange in some way to let us know we’re not on Earth. People are similar to Earthlings. Everyone has heard of The Lands Below, but no one has been there. The common knowledge is the people there are strange, foreboding, unfriendly, quarrelsome, warmon- gers—and that’s just the better ones. 

Torin’s primary initial challenge is to find the entrance to The Lands Below, which he does with the help of an eccentric hermit, who lives nearby. 

 

Escarpa (î-skärp¹e), the first of the inner worlds, resembles the U. S. desert Southwest, with lots of stone, red rocks, painted desert, vertical cliffs. It is a dry climate, with enough water to support only a few scrubby desert plants. (Picture Grand Canyon from the inside looking up.) A few thin wispy clouds float here and there inside the surface lid. 

Most of the buildings are built directly into caverns and the sides of sheer rock cliffs, yet the buildings have de- tailing that makes it clear they’re not Indian. (Picture Anasazi Pueblos with formal porticos, formal gardens, tile, Roman columns or ??) They look ancient and yet futuristic, sophisticated and yet dated. 

Home of Leenah, Torin’s love interest. Unlike her, all the rest of her people are short, hairy, ugly, overweight, and dyspeptic. Everyone makes excuses for Leenah’s looks, so when Torin finally meets her, he is surprised that she is beautiful, tall, athletic, healthy, and attractive. 

  

pûr¹ge-la is darker, dimly lit, with artificial light a necessity, very damp, with water dripping, flowing, running, splashing, dancing everywhere. The land is filled with ferns, waterfalls, dripping cliffs, thick with plant life, jungle like growth. Lots of creepers, climbers, vines, lianas, convolvulus, bindweed, fern, bracken, moss, club moss, peat moss, sphagnum moss. The people are very small, perhaps eight inches tall. Lots of contrast from Escarpa. 



às-thê´nê-e is the land of molten rock, filled with rivers of flowing lava, kind of a magma a la carta. Everything is colored in shades of reds, browns, oranges. Light source is often the lava streams. Fumes spurt from holes in the ground. Paint pots, geysers, volcanism of all kinds. (Picture Yellowstone Park.) The people are involved with lava in many ways: work, play, hobbies, every application you can imagine, Working in and around smoke and fire all day makes them frequently black-stained and sooty. Rough and tumble, muscular, compact, thick skin that doesn’t burn easily. 

-   

tèn´e-bres is the dark zone, with little natural light, and the look and feel of a cave interior: rocky, metallic, dry. The people are near albinos, with blondish-white hair, tall, thin, weak, some Blade Runner high tech that’s never really explained, dramatic directional light and shadows. Everything is dark and gloomy…except the people. They are hilarious, full of one-liners and puns, everybody has a smart answer to everything, which is just their way of over- compensating for their cimmerian environment. Home of the evil sorceress, Lycentia. 

To get to Lycentia’s outpost hermitage, you must pass through the Null Void, an uninhabited place, empty, void, and hollow, a “gravity null” that makes it behave like outer space, but with air to breath, so spacesuits are unneces- sary. Imagine a vast open cave, with the only light coming from the intersecting crystals that begin here.

You are Torin, a young farm boy. Your parents have been imprisoned in a magic spell. An old traveler tells you the name of the evil sorceress who did it. You vow to find her and force her to release them. To reach her, you must travel great distances, take life-threatening risks, meet many strange creatures and solve many puzzles. 

However, for adult players, there is considerably more complication, intricacy, and motivation. You must travel deep into The Lands Below, through level after level of fantastic lands filled with unique people, before your cli- matic confrontation with the evil Lycentia. Along the way you will learn that: 

- your parents are really your foster parents 
- your birth parents were murdered when you were a baby 
- on the night of the killing, your nanny ran away to safety, taking you with her 
- she was discovered hiding you, convicted of kidnapping, and ostracized to The Lands Below 
- the Arch-Authority hid you with your foster parents to protect you until you were grown 
- your former nanny has now become Lycentia, the same evil sorceress you seek 
- the old traveler is really your uncle, Pecand 
- Pecand only told you about Lycentia so you would undertake this potentially fatal quest 
- Pecand murdered your birth parents and still wants you out of the way because… 
- your father was the King of The Lands Above…and thus, you are its Crown Prince. 

Truly, everything in Torin’s Passage is not as it appears…including you! 

-  

Note: All of the following back story information is dribbled out to the game player throughout the course of the game via the opening cartoons and several short “flashbacks.” These occur between chapters and are skippable via the “fast forward” icon. 

Pecand was next in line for the throne until his older brother, King Heuron, finally had an heir. Realizing his chance at succession was now slim, Pecand waited until the court left the castle for its annual summer visit to the royal lakeside retreat. There he would murder the entire royal family. As he prepared a deadly potion, the baby Torin became fussy, so his nanny took him for a walk outside on the adjacent terrace. Pecand sneaked into the royal bed- room, did his dirty deed, and escaped back to his chambers. But the evil green “smoke snake” vapors missed the child. 

The nanny, Lycentia, saw the vapors before re-entering the chamber, realized treachery was afoot, then quickly fled through the countryside with the child, fully intending only to keep him from danger. Soldiers found her pro- tecting the child in a barn. Although the Arch-Authority, Kurtzwell, could find no evidence of Lycentia’s involve- ment in the murder, she was found guilty of kidnapping. To protect the baby, Lycentia was banished to The Lands Below, with a magic collar placed around her neck that would strangle her should she ever return to the surface. 

Kurtzwell didn’t believe Lycentia acted alone. He correctly suspected Pecand, but had absolutely no proof. Therefore, Torin was still in danger—but from whom? To protect the child, Kurtzwell had it placed with a coopera- tive couple on a distant farm, after convincing the Council of Authorities that Pecand should be denied the throne as long as the boy lived. “When the child reaches maturity, he shall become the next and rightful King. In the meantime, the Council of Authorities will prevail.” 

Lycentia is bitter and filled with resentment at her unfair punishment. After all, she was only trying to do her duty: to protect the child. She grew older, fatter, uglier, and increasingly bitter in The Lands Below. She eventually turned to the dark side, becoming a powerful sorceress in a futile attempt to remove the magic collar in order to re- turn home to The Lands Above. 

Meanwhile, on the surface, after fifteen years of searching, Pecand finally learns the whereabouts of Torin, but knows if the boy is killed outright Kurtzwell will surely suspect him. So instead, he contacts Lycentia and negotiates a deal: if she will help him gain power, he will remove the collar from her neck and grant her the freedom she de- sires. All she need do is place some farm couple under a magic spell. Then when he’s the new Arch-Authority, he’ll release Lycentia and allow her to return to The Lands Above. As a bonus, she’ll also get revenge on Kurtzwell, whom she hates. 

Suspecting a double-cross, Lycentia agrees to Pecand’s offer, planning to double-cross him once she gains her freedom. Disguised as a beggar, Pecand hides near Torin’s home, while Lycentia casts her spell on his parents. He tells Torin, “I saw the whole thing!” He drops the information that someone named Lycentia is responsible. As Pe- cand predicted, Torin, headstrong and cock-sure, immediately vows to save his parents. “I’ll find that evil sorceress and force her to break the spell! Even if she is in The Lands Below!” 

Pecand smiles beneath his disguise. Once in The Lands Below, Torin will be an easy target for the legions of robbers, thieves and ne’er-do-wells rumored to live there. But even if he does survive the journey, Lycentia will eas- ily handle this foolish boy. But really, either way is acceptable, as Torin will eliminate himself of his own volition and Pecand will be totally uninvolved. “And at last I will finally assume what is rightfully mine: the throne of The Lands Above!” 

- 

While the main plot of Torin’s Passage concerns the search for and rescue of your parents from the evil sorcer- ess, it includes sub-plots of deception and murder, mistaken identity, the overthrow of authority, revenge, righting an injustice, and the improvement of material well-being (if you consider becoming a Crown Prince a rags-to-riches story). 

However, to balance this “dark side” of the game, the protagonists, and the characters they meet, are much more light-hearted and game play is filled with puns, silly jokes and over-the-kids’-heads references that only adults will catch. 

-   

The theme of Torin’s Passage is “achieve your dream.” Torin’s personal growth, from an unsure adolescent to an accomplished adventurer and hero, comes in spite of his early self-doubt. This emphasizes the “rite of passage” aspect of the game. Along the way, he overcomes prejudice and grows mentally, spiritually and physically. By get- ting to know the people of The Lands Below, he finds they are far from the savages his own people made them out to be. In future games, he will be instrumental in re-uniting the five worlds into one country.

*Part I: Coup d'État!* 

The King’s brother, Pecand, attempts to assassinate the royal family with poison gas while they’re sleeping. The baby Torin escapes, thanks to his nanny, Lycentia, who realizes he is in danger and spirits him away through the woods. Fade to black. 

*Part II: Spellcast Away* 

Torin’s (foster) parents ask him to run an errand in town. Soon after he leaves, he sees a dramatic green haze and hears a clap of thunder. Spinning around, he sees his parents captured in a magic spell. He runs to help. 

*Part III: Planting the Seed* 

A disguised Pecand hints that Lycentia did it. Torin vows to find her. Pecand leaves. Game play begins. 

 "  

Torin explores the woods and finds an old guardhouse. The Old Guard assumes he’s the replacement guard and makes him fix dinner, per guardhouse tradition. Playing along, Torin fetches and prepares food for the old man, thereby gaining access to the phenocryst chamber. He solves the crystal-toggling puzzle to obtain the eressdy powder he needs to travel through the portal and return safely. He then uses the powder to propel himself and Boogle into the phenocryst column and onward to Escarpa. 

**Flashback** 

*Part I: The Discovery* 

A soldier reports the death of the royal couple to Kurtzwell. “And the child?” “Missing, sir.” “The child must be found!” Kurtzwell barks. Fade to black. 

*Part II: Capture!* 

Soldiers searching through the woods come upon a small barn. Inside the barn, Lycentia huddles, holding the baby. She hears orders barked, the sounds of soldiers searching. The baby fusses a little. Lycentia, afraid, tries to quiet the baby. The door opens, its light crossing Lycentia’s face as she reacts in fear. Capture! Fade to black. 

"

Escarpa (î-skärp¹e) is unique in its use of a five-screen-tall, vertically-scrolling picture, plus two other scrollable pictures that actually require the player to use the scroll control handle to solve their puzzles. Its people are short, hairy, and ugly, except for the Princess Leenah, whom they consider a freak. When Torin finally meets her (later on, down in Pergola), he realizes she’s only ugly to her people. To Torin (and us), she’s beautiful. 

Scattered throughout Escarpa are nine tiles with abstract geometric shapes on them. Torin must find them all and mount them on a wall with nine corresponding openings. When he places all the tiles in the correct holes at the proper rotation, the pieces morph into a claymation, living, face-O-stone, which tells the story of the phenocryst col- umns and how they work. It then slides open to reveal a chamber containing another phenocryst column leading to Pergola. 

**Flashback: Trial & Punishment** 

Arch-Authority Kurtzwell sits behind an imposing bench. “Before I pronounce judgment, have you anything to say?” Lycentia responds, “The child? Is he safe?” “Far away, where he will come to no harm!” Kurtzwell pro- nounces the sentence: she is ostracized to live in The Lands Below forever! “…and should you dare to return, this ostracizing  collar  will  choke  you!”  We  see  the  collar  installed  and  Lycentia  whisked  away  through  the  same phenocryst column Torin used a while ago at the guardhouse.

pûr¹ge-la is darker, dimly lit, very damp, with water dripping, flowing, running, splashing, dancing everywhere. A jungle land, it is filled with ferns, waterfalls, dripping cliffs, and thick with plant life. Lots of creepers, climbers, vines, lianas, convolvulus, bindweed, fern, bracken, moss, club moss, and sphagnum moss. The people are low-lying, compact, hairy. (Picture Yoda.) They make their homes inside tree roots. The land of the little people, Torin finds Leenah tied up by a band of warriors, 8” tall. He rescues her. They are interested in each other, but will wait until the sequel before any fireworks happen. 

**Flashback: Pecand Negotiates with Lycentia** 

We see Pecand and Lycentia negotiating their dirty deal to “place the Fahrmans in a magic spell” via a vidcryst. Pecand convinces her that if she does it, he’ll become the new Arch-Authority and she’ll get her freedom and get even with Kurtzwell for wronging her those fifteen years ago.

às-thê´nê-e is the land of molten rock, filled with rivers of flowing lava, kind of a magma a la carta. Everything is colored in shades of reds, browns, oranges. The light source is often the lava stream itself. Fumes spurt from holes in the ground. There are paint pots, geysers, and volcanism of all kinds. (Picture Yellowstone Park.) There are no people. (If there were, they would be involved with lava in many ways: work, play, hobbies, every application imag- inable. Being in and around smoke and fire all day would make them black-stained and sooty. They would be rough and tumble, muscular, compact, with thick skin that doesn’t burn easily. But they aren’t, ‘cause they aren’t.) 

**Cut Scene: “Get them, my pretty!”** 

Using the vidcryst, Pecand warns Lycentia that Torin is about to reach Tenebrous. She gets angry and for the first time, we see her start to grow in size. As she does, the collar tightens and she chokes, weakens, grows dizzy. She forces herself to relax, calm down, regain control, then assures Pecand she’ll “make sure the boy doesn’t find me…or his parents!” She sends Dreep to Tenebrous to keep Torin and Boogle from reaching her.

Everything is dark and gloomy…except the people. They are hilarious, full of one-liners and puns, everybody has a smart answer to everything, which is just their way of over- compensating for their cimmerian environment. 

Torin must get arrested twice, which is enough for the judge to toss him out of Tenebrous into the Null Void. Along the way, he undergoes an audition at the Tenebrous Bowl on musical saw, collects a book of magic to use on Lycentia, and a recording of her voice. 

**Cut Scene during Chapter 5: Dreep Grabs Your Boogle** 

While you are in jail for “cruelty to plants,” you look out your cell window to see Dreep capture Boogle and carry him away, back to Lycentia’s Lair. Even though the judge releases you on probation, there’s no way to get back your Boogle. Now you really want to get Lycentia! 

**Cut Scene during Chapter 5: Into The Null Void** 

After being arrested again (this time for “impersonating a musician”), the judge ostracizes you from Tenebrous, ordering you sent into the Null Void. Since you now know this leads to Lycentia’s Lair, this is exactly where you want to go. 

 "#

Torin confronts Lycentia, but she only laughs at him. When she does, her collar tightens, this time rendering her unconscious. Torin takes pity on her, brushing the collar with his hand, which releases it instantly.  

*Closing: Justice is Done* 

Lycentia regains her strength, grows in size again, but now nothing restrains her. She zaps Torin, exposing his birthmark. As she heads for him to finish him off, she sees the birthmark, stops, feels her neck for the missing collar, sees it lying on the floor, puts everything together and realizes who he is. “I was your nanny. I saved your life the night your parents were murdered.” 

Torin’s confused. “Murdered? No! How could you? When I left them, they were alive, but in a magic spell— that you cast!” “No, Torin. That farm couple must be your foster parents, because your real parents were the King and Queen of The Lands Above!” “Then I’m…” Lycentia says, “That’s right. You’re the next king!” 

Pecand enters, with dagger drawn, “No, you’re wrong. I’m the next king!” Then he stabs Lycentia in the back. As she drops to the floor, he pulls out the knife and starts for Torin. Pecand & Torin struggle for the dagger, but Pe- cand wins. He holds the dagger to Torin’s throat, “For fifteen years I’ve searched for you, my little nephew Torin. And now you won’t escape! I killed your parents…and now I’ll kill you!” 

As Pecand raises the dagger, Lycentia regains enough strength to zap Pecand into a magic spell. The dagger bounces harmlessly off Torin’s neck and falls to the floor. She releases the Fahrmans and Boogle and returns with Torin to The Lands Above. 

*Closing Credits: The Coronation Ceremony* 

While a stately march plays in the background, we watch the royal Coronation Ceremony formally naming Torin as Crown Prince as his friends and family stand nearby. As Torin receives his crown, Boogle receives new official status as Court Jester. Roll the credits.

*Play field* 

·  Before starting the game, if the user is running in a screen mode > 640x480, fill their entire desktop 

with some subtle, tasty, repeating wallpaper, in a Strata-like pattern. Their Windows desktop will not show through. 

·  Place a small border around the graphic window as a frame. ·  Do not force user back into 256-color mode. 

*Save/Restore* 

·  When you die, an Oops button always takes you back to just before you screwed up. 

·  At the end of every chapter and upon exit, Auto-save to an unnamed save game file. If that file exists, 

offer to return to it upon game bootup. 

·  Drop the “name your game before you begin” feature of KQ7. Instead, name it when you Save it, like 

all other software. 

·  Add the ability to Save, Restore, and Restart the game at any time. 

·  Add standard Windows keystroke equivalents: Alt-F, S to save, Alt-F, X to exit, etc. 

*Cursor* 

·  Keep the hot cursor that changes shape when it’s over an active spot. ·  Keep the arrows that point to walkable exits. 

·  Drop the “Exit” button on insets or POV screens. Instead, whenever the cursor is within a few pixels of 

the Left, Right, or Bottom edges, change it to a backspace shape to indicate “return to previous screen.” 

*Title Bar* 

·  Keep the standard Windows title bar, in the user’s choice of Windows colors and font, but make it 

normally invisible. A pull-down menu item under Game turns it on and off. It only appears when the mouse is over it at the top of the screen. When it does appear, game play is suspended. 

·  The title bar, when visible, contains a standard Windows close button, with the minimum subset of commands (Minimize, Maximize, Close, Switch To…, etc.) Accept the usual Alt-keys equivalents. 

·  At the far right of the Title Bar are the standard Minimize and Resize buttons. The Minimize button re-

duces the game to an icon on the user’s desktop. This should have a hot key equivalent of Alt-B, as it is now the “boss key.” The Resize button changes the game from full-screen to user-adjustable size. This size is stored between games in the .INI file and restored along with a restore. 

*Pull down menus* 

·  When the cursor gets above 20Y, a translucent menu bar appears. It works just like other Windows 

menus, but it’s implemented in SCI, with views for the text items. 

·  A File menu is at left, containing New, Open…, Save, Save As…, and Exit. 

·  A Game menu is next, containing Scrolling, Text, Transcript, Title Bar, and Speed. The first four have 

a check-mark to the left of the text to indicate whether they’re turned off or on. When you select Speed, a window similar to our Inventory close-up view appears. In it is a normal-scaled ego. Pressing the but- tons makes ego walk faster and slower. The + and - keys also adjust speed without the fancy interface. 

·  A Help menu is next, containing Interface, Hints, Customer Support, and About Torin’s Passage… 

*Center well* 

·  The multi-purpose center well normally contains the player’s Inventory items. There is room for scroll 

buttons on each end of Inventory well, in case we get too many items to display at once. However, by pressing one of the three buttons (Inventory, Boogletory, and Text buttons), the center well changes from Inventory objects to Boogle actions to a transcript of recently-heard text. 

*Inventory button* 

·  The Inventory button looks like Torin’s closed purse. When depressed, it changes into an open purse 

and fills the center well with your current Inventory objects. 

*Boogle button* 

·  The Boogle button looks like a bored Boogle. When depressed, it changes into an active Boogle and 

fills the center well with potential Boogle actions—a “Boogletory!” 

*Transcript button* 

·  The transcript button looks like a closed book when non-active. When pressed, it changes into an open 

book and transforms the center Inventory well into the transcript buffer. 

*Inventory well* 

·  Click on an object in the Inventory well to make it the active icon. Works like KQ7, except objects re-

main where they are placed, like eggs in an egg carton. 

*Boogletory well* 

·  The Boogletory contains icons representing potential Boogle actions. Click one to make it the active 

icon. If you click it on the eye, Boogle moves to a location in the current room known to have enough 

room for this purpose (hopping out of Torin’s pack first, if necessary) and perform that transformation. ·  If you click a Boogle icon on something in the game, he’ll do it, if he can. 

*Transcript buffer well* 

·  The transcript buffer is a scrollable text buffer containing with the last 20 +/- lines of dialogue. It has a 

standard Windows-style scroll bar with elevator (just like the Larry6 text buffer, but the arrow keys automatically repeat). Each line of text has an audio speaker icon besides the talker’s name. Click the speaker to replay that line’s audio file. 

*Look eyeball icon* 

·  Works the same as KQ7: select an object from the Inventory well. Click it on the eyeball. Up pops the 

Inventory close-up view window. 

*Inventory close-up view window* 

·  Has a Windows-style title bar on top, with a close button on the left and the object’s name centered in 

the bar. 

·  a 5-button tape transport controls the speed of the object’s vertical (or horizontal) rotation 

*Score* 

·  A 3 digit, rotating odometer (like Larry6) is visible on the interface at all times. In addition, a “chapter 

progress” thermometer shows your progress through the current chapter. 

·  If you haven’t played the game from the beginning, your score is reset to 0 with each new chapter. You 

continue to earn points for your actions, but your total score is invalid. 

*VCR controls* 

·  Three buttons are always visible on the interface: Fast Forward, Pause, and Rewind. 

·  The Pause button pauses and restarts the game. Press it to bring up a dialog stopping the game totally. 

The dialog has a “Continue” button. 

·  The Fast Forward button is active only during long non-interactive sequences. Press it to go directly to 

the next interactive moment in the game. 

·  The Rewind button is only active immediately after a particularly noteworthy non-interactive sequence. 

Press it to return to the beginning of the previous sequence so you can see it again, in case you missed something. It becomes inactive as soon as the player does almost anything except walk around. 

*Scroll slider* 

·  A small yellow handle that appears occasionally, on the edge of large scrolling pix. Used to move 

around in large pictures. 

*Interface Help* 

·  Add msWord-style verb labels, black text on yellow background, that only appear if you hold the cur-

sor still over the icon for at least five seconds. 

·  Add Larry6-style interface help in large windows. Steal code and text from Larry6. Keep these win-

dows from hiding the area each discusses. 

*Logo* 

·  May be omitted, since we can’t come up with something useful for it to do.

*Torin’s Passage* Design Document As of: Tuesday, November 25, 2003 

Copyright 1995 by Al Lowe for Sierra On-Line, Inc. Page 17 

Torin—our hero, our ego, nearing manhood, in- telligent, fit, muscular, handsome, a natural athlete, resourceful, honest, moral, articulate, strong, yet still an  adolescent,  immature,  naive,  headstrong,  impa- tient,  untested.  He  wonders  about  his  own  bravery and manhood, whether he’ll rise to the test. Born to the royal Family Ondaate, he barely escaped with his life when his parents King Heuron & Queen Calixa were assassinated when he was a baby. Hidden with a cooperative  rural  farm  couple  by  Arch-Authority Kurtzwell,  at  the  beginning  of  the  story  he  knows nothing  of  his  royal  heritage.  Filled  with  bravado, overly-confident,  ready  to  “fight  to  the  death!”,  he jumps at the chance to explore The Lands Below, to save his “parents,” to search for and stop the evil sor- ceress. A cross between Luke Skywalker and Alad- din. 

Heuron—King of The Lands Above until he was murdered by his brother, Pecand. Torin’s birth father. Once head of the Family Ondaate and ruler of all The Lands above. This is a bit part, since he only appears in the opening cartoon, and then is immediately killed in  his  sleep.  Kingly,  good,  royal.  No  voice  over needed,  as  he  has  no  lines.  (But  if  there  were,  it would have to be by James Earl Jones, of course.) 

Calixa—Queen  of  The  Lands  Above  until  she was murdered by her brother-in-law, Pecand. Torin’s birth  mother.  Another  bit  part,  only  appears  in  the opening  cartoon,  then  immediately  killed  in  sleep. Queenly, regal, good cheekbones, nice hand acting. No voice-over needed. 

Pecand—brother of the King, Pecand was next in line  for  the  throne  until  the  childless  royal  couple finally  had  a  son,  our  hero,  Torin.  Realizing  his chance of succession is gone, Pecand tries to kill the entire royal family, but misses the baby Torin. Fifteen years  later,  he  strikes  a  deal  with  Lycentia  (once Torin’s nanny, but now an evil sorceress) to cast a spell on Torin’s foster parents. The game’s bad guy, evil,  wicked,  sinful,  sneaky,  double-crossing.  If  it were a melodrama, he’d be twisting his mustache as the buzzsaw approached Miss Lonnie. At the end of the  game,  Lycentia  seals  his  spirit  inside  a  crystal cocoon  magic  spell,  “locked  away  forever!”  (That way he can return in the sequel.) Tommy Lee Jones, Jafir, Darth Vadar’s boss. 

Lycentia—Torin’s nanny at the time of the King 

- Queen’s assassination, she fled the royal compound with the child to protect him. Tracked down, she was suspected of killing his parents to keep the child for herself, but with no evidence, only convicted of steal- ing the child. Unable to prove her innocent intentions, she  was  fitted  with  a  magic  collar  that  chokes  her should she ever return to the surface, then ostracized to  The  Lands  Below  via  the  telemirror.  Justifiably bitter and resentful, she turned to the dark side and during the fifteen-year break in our story became a powerful sorceress. She also changed from the young, innocent, loving, caring nurturer of the back story, to a sour, ill-natured and embittered hag. As she aged, she also gained weight, but the magic collar did not expand  with  her.  Now  she  speaks  with  a  breathy, gasping,  choking  rasp.  Lycentia  is  the  game’s  ulti- mate goal and ostensibly its evil female, but eventu- ally she proves herself to have a heart of gold. Her gravely voice is a cross between Selma Diamond and Darth Vader, always out of breath, gasping, wheez- ing. 

  Kurtzwell—the  Arch-Authority,  head  of  the Council  of  Authorities.  Kurtzwell  is  the  stabilizing force in the kingdom following the assassination of the royal couple. Kurtzwell persuaded the Council of Authorities to rule The Lands Above themselves until Torin,  the  rightful  leader,  reaches  his  maturity. Kurtzwell pronounces Lycentia’s sentence where she is ostracized to The Lands Below for “stealing” the baby Torin. Kurtzwell is the only one who knows the whereabouts  of  Torin  as  he  grows  up.  Completely honest, good, self-effacing, noble, aristocratic, above petty  politics,  he  is  the  strongest  character  in  the story. 

  The  Fahrmans—Torin’s  foster  parents,  a  rural farm couple who have raised him as their son. Torin believes them to be his birth parents. Another bit part with no voice-over, since they spend the entire game trapped in a magic spell! 

  Boogle—a  small  creature,  part  monkey,  part cocker  spaniel,  all  cute  (think  “stuffed  animal rights”). Torin’s pet and companion. Dog-loyal, mon- key-agile,  observant,  simple,  mischievous,  speech- challenged. Boogle insists upon traveling with Torin on his quest. Boogle has the wonderful ability to alter 

*Torin’s Passage* Design Document As of: Tuesday, November 25, 2003 

Copyright 1995 by Al Lowe for Sierra On-Line, Inc. Page  

his body in nearly any way, to assume any shape con- sistent with his mass. Unfortunately, he can’t take on the  characteristics  of  that  object.  So  while  Torin might need an ax, and Boogle can reshape himself to look like an ax, when Torin swings him into a tree, he gets  a  headache  and  gets  knocked  silly.  He  often proves  useful,  although  he  still  disappears  into Torin’s pack for long periods of time (usually when- ever  the  programmers  require  him  off-screen).  He When Torin first enters a scene, Boogle will move around on his own, sniffing out objects to shape-shift into that might prove useful to Torin later. Boogle is our “aaaaahhh!” character. Kids identify with him. At some  point,  he  “saves  the  day”  in  spite  of  being treated like the “little kid.” Think: Gurgi, Abu, (but more intense than Flounder). He speaks, but in word- like noises only Torin can understand. Use John Byn- ner for his voice? 

Slim & Slime—two snails with aggressive per- sonalities. Smart remarks, witty, fun, they give you clues about the slug puzzle. 

Zippy—the inchworm you find in your Mom’s sewing  basket.  Zippy  is  nearly  instantaneous  when measuring, just the opposite of the snails and slugs. High voice, fast talker, always in a hurry. 

Zax—the  Drawbridge  Guard.  Small  part.  Tells you  there  is  no  way  for  you  to  enter  the  city. “HALT!” “Get lost, kid.” 

Herman—large part in Chapter 1. The Old Guard hermit  who’s  saving the world from those bastards from  The  Lands  Below!  Wants  you  to  fix  dinner. Specifies things you must find and prepare. Most of them are icky. Mentally confused, yet lucid at times. Sort of remembers phenocryst, but can’t recall how they worked.

Mr.  Bitternut—Although  Mr.  and  the  kids  are there, Mrs. Bitternut does all the talking for the fam- ily. 

Mrs. Bitternut—Mrs. Bitternut does all the talk- ing. She’s not only nuts, she’s bitter as well. And sar- castic. And rude. And an asshole. Our answer to the Jerky Boys. 

Billy  Bitternut—Doesn’t  get  much  chance  to talk, as Mrs. Bitternut does all the talking. Has a pet yo-yo which teaches Boogle a thing or one. 

Rupert, King of Escarpa—mounted on his throne in the Throne Room at the Escarpa Cliffs Scroller 2R, Rupert is the height of pretension and royal partici- ple-dangling. He sounds just like Prince Charles, of course. Hard of hearing. 

Di, Queen of Escarpa—mounted on her throne in the Throne Room at the Escarpa Cliffs Scroller 2R. Queen Di takes advantage of Rupert’s hearing prob- lem to put him down. Of course she sounds Brit. 

Veder—mounted on his stone seat at the edge of the Escarpa cliffs, he has problems with hemorrhoids, although we never use that word or explain to the kids 

playing what he’s talking about. All he wants from you is a pillow. 

Sam & Max—the two male skunks that live in the back of skunk cave in Escarpa. 

Tripe & Viscera—two vultures who live at Es- carpa 5. Sound like prototypical garbage truck drivers with  Brooklyn  or  Bronx  accents,  or  maybe  one  of each. 

Washer  Women—the  non-babes  working  the stream on the West Cliff. Animated and performed en masse, they have lines but no C. U.’s and are dressed like Russian street cleaners. 

Harem  Girls—the  odalisque  babes.  Animated and performed en masse, they have no lines, and are dressed as conservatively as Princess Jasmine. 

Dino—famous  for  dropping  shit  in  a  cave,  he only occasionally flies by, casting a huge shadow on the cliffs. 

Phenophace—a large, carved-stone wall that be- comes a living, speaking face of stone. Needs a deep, slow, bass voice, with lots of resonance.

Leenah—Torin’s  love  interest.  Leenah  is  ser- “she’s so polite,” and “she’s very good to her par- iously  down-played  in  this  game,  but  will  provide  ents.”  When  Torin  finally  sees  her,  he understands plenty of material for the sequel. Before he meets her,  why:  she’s  actually  a  beautiful,  long-haired,  long- whenever  Torin  asks  about  her  looks,  her  relatives  legged bombshell about Torin’s age. She has a dis- respond with lines like, “she has a nice personality,”  tinctive  look,  perhaps  like  a  quasi-Oriental  Elle

MacPherson.  You  boastfully  announce  you’ll  save her from her dilemma, but she turns out to be a capa- ble heroine in her own right. Eventually you do “help her,” but only after she saves you from danger first. Tia Carrera, but more so. 

Smetana — the Pergolan President. Smetana is the  only  one  of  the  little  people  with  whom  you speak. 

Little people—many little guys, all in identical uniforms, all the same animation loops. Cheap, quick, but non-dirty. 

Ostiaries — the ten little people attending to the entrance to the phenocryst chamber. They argue near the pentagram about who should stand where. All ten are similar in action and dress (one set of animation should cover all ten), but four are alike in one way, but different in four other ways. In other words: every guy has five characteristics, each of which matches three others. What are the five characteristics?

Cop—a local, with a badge. 

Judge—a  smarter  local,  with  a  robe  and  a big 

bench. 

Mrs.  Plant—well-rooted  in  the  troubles  of  the Plant Kingdom. Ego talks to her, picks the silkworms off her friends and she convinces the grasses to talk him up the Slippery Slope. 

Sappy Tree—gets very sentimental and begins to cry, oozing sap in the process.  

Silkworms—these  are  like  normal  silkworms, except  they’re  chameleon-like  in  their  ability  to change colors based on the surface they’re on. Put them on a colorful old poster and you’ll get a brightly colored silk kerchief. 

Squeaking  Grass—no  close-ups,  no  way  of knowing what the look like, you just hear them as they lead you up the Slippery Slope. 

Assistant Director—gives Torin clues as to what to do next. “Are you that musical saw player?” Wan- ders around backstage giving orders. Gets Torin to go on-stage. Thin, brainy, gay, hyper. 

Tap-dancing  centipede—just  a  walk-through only. Tosses his top hat and cane on a table as he exits via the Stage Door just so Torin can take them. 

Archer—this guy shoots apples off the top of a rabbit’s head but keeps missing. Get mad when Rab- bit quits the act and throws his bow. 

Rabbit—uses his ears to make the rat hit the ap- ple with his arrow. Gets mad, and quits the act. 

Blind Magician—whoever heard of a blind ma- gician? At least he thinks his tricks are working. 

R.  Kyvest—collects  recordings  of  the  famous, and near-famous, voices of Tenebrous. Small, mousy character, pale skin, Caspar the ghost. 

Acrobats—would fit in on Ed Sullivan: a circus act with one large guy lying down spinning a small young girl on his feet. No lines. 

Carpenter—working  joe,  bit  part,  no  dialogue. Saws  board,  climbs  ladder,  nails  off-screen, climbs down, leaves (forgetting his saw). Rough and tumble, not too bright, working class wage slob. 

Director—a dark silhouette out in the audience. No lines. 

Dreep—Lycentia’s sidekick, gofer, lackey. Slap- stick,  bumbling,  dumb,  awkward,  nasty,  wise- cracking, but not wholly bad. For our purposes, he’s there to lessen the impact of Lycentia’s evil on kids. A  non-human  Lou  Costello/Buddy  Hackett/Ned Beatty type.

Created from the tap-dancing centipede’s cane. Given to the Magician as part of the magic trick. Or given to magician after he requests it. 

**Magic Trick** 

Produced when you combine the top hat and silk kerchief in Inventory. Give to the magician to get the Book of Magic. 

**Book of Magic** 

Get from the blind magician in Tenebrous in ex- change for the magic trick. Torin tries to use this on Lycentia, but it only makes her mad. A red herring, but a must have. 

**Bagpipes** 

Get backstage in Tenebrous. Use in Null Void as a means of propulsion. 

**Crystcorder** 

Get this shard player from R. Kyvest in exchange for a recording of your own voice. Before you com- bine  it  with  either  the  Audcryst  or  the  Shattered Shard, all three behave like standard Inventory ob- jects. But clicking any of the three onto another per- manently  places  the  shard  inside  the  crystcorder, drops the shard from Inventory and gives you a few points. From then on, looking at the Crystcorder takes you to… 

*The Crystcorder C. U.* 

The crystcorder is an elaborate, ornate, jeweled, presentation case that opens like a chest to reveal two velvet grooves and a golden play button. The near groove  has  an  icon  beside  it  indicating  silence  or storage. The far groove’s icon indicates sound. Put a shard in the storage groove and nothing happens. Put it in the play groove, press the play button, and the shard glows with an interesting light effect and you hear the pre-recorded sound. Thus you may listen to your shard both before and after it’s broken. 

When the Audcryst is in the play groove, it just plays  back  Lycentia’s  voice  as  recorded.  Once  the shard is shattered and you look at the crystcorder, you see the broken pieces of shard lying in the storage groove.  You  can  select  any  piece  (the  individual pieces do not enter Inventory) and place it on the top row, anywhere it fits, in any order. Press the play but- ton while pieces are in the play groove, and we play back  the  corresponding  voice  snippets  using  actual audio samples, with silence equivalent to the spaces between shards. 

Your  goal  is  to  assemble  something  along  the lines of “Mr. Watson, come here. I want you.” from the original phrase that was in the shard. One particu- lar pattern of shards chips will attract Dreep’s atten- tion when you need to enter Lycentia’s Lair.

Finally,  once  the  Crystcorder  has  a  successful 

playback sequence, it is turned on in the Null Void 

and left on an asteroid to distract and confuse Dreep, 

allowing you to slip into Lycentia’s Lair.  **Saw** 

Dreep, you come here. You come here, Dreep. 

*Torin’s Passage* Design Document  Copyright 1995 by Al Lowe for Sierra On-Line, Inc. As of: Tuesday, November 25, 2003  Page  

**Audcryst** 

Get this shard of Lycentia’s voice from R. Ky- vest in exchange for a recording of your own voice. Combine  it  in  Inventory  with  the  Crystcorder  (see above). Before it is broken, it contains Lycentia yell- ing at the old archivist, “You’re not welcome here, you decrepit old creep!” 

**Shattered Shard** 

Created  when the cop slams you into the Null Void  vault  door,  shattering  Lycentia’s  prerecorded shard into 8 pieces, as shown by the slashes: “You’re n / ot wel / come h / ere / you / d / ecrepit old c / reep!” 

The boldface indicates shards to use in the final sequence. The “D” must be before the “reep” and the “come h” and “ere” shards must be in order some- where, and the “you” is optional. This makes any of the following acceptable: 

Dreep, come here. Come here, Dreep. 

Get after the carpenter finishes building his set backstage in Tenebrous. Combine it with the Rosined Bow  to  make  “beautiful”  music  on  the  Tenebrous stage. “This must be a ‘band saw,’” thinks Torin. 

**Bow** 

Get from the backstage wall where the nervous rat archer threw it once the rabbit quits his act. If you combine the archer’s bow and the saw in Inventory, you get a few scratchy, bad-sounding notes, with a clue about how “your bow needs more rosin.” 

**Rosin** 

Get  from  the  acrobat  backstage  in  Tenebrous. Combine with the bow in Inventory to create a better- sounding bow. 

**Rosined Bow** 

Make in Inventory by combining the bow and the rosin. If you then combine the newly-rosined bow and the saw in Inventory, we hear a few lovely notes, with a clue about waiting your turn to go on.

Open on close-up of incense burner peacefully smoking inside Royal Bedroom. While we hold on this shot, we hear the first faint sounds of a storm brewing. 

As we hear the first rumble, we rack focus to the bed, begin a slow dolly around the incense burner, past it, and toward the bed. We hear a baby awakened by the storm. The camera continues over the royal bed, revealing our King and Queen, ending on the opposite side of the bed with the Queen in the foreground, where we pause on her face, with her nearby hand showing us her royal ring. Her eyelids flutter as she hears the child, but she does not fully awaken. 

Cut from Queen’s hand to Pecand’s hand, with rings aligned. Pecand opens his royal ring, loads it with green powder. The camera zooms out from over Pecand’s shoulder as we again hear the storm and the now-distant cry of the baby in the other room. Pecand turns slightly as he hears the cry, but his face remains in shadow. 

We cut back to the royal bedroom as the camera passes the end of the bed and sweeps by the hallway door. We see Lycentia enter through the doorway. The camera continues its move, taking her out of frame as it sweeps toward the crib. As the camera finishes its move, we see Lycentia bend over the crib and pick up the child. 

Cut to a reverse wide angle shot from over the Queen’s shoulder. Lycentia walks towards the terrace as the Queen goes back to sleep. 

Lycentia exits bedroom, enters terrace and sits on the terrace railing. The baby’s cries weaken, even though the storm continues to build. 

The storm clouds suffocate the two moons. (Symbolism warning!!) 

Pecand pulls his robe’s hood up and over his head as he walks into the camera, his body eventually filling the screen.

Pecand walks out of the camera, exits his room, and heads down the main hallway to the royal bedroom. 

Pecand enters the royal bedroom. He looks at the bed, then the crib, then heads toward the incense burner. 

Pecand’s hand opens the incense burner, and in a matching move, opens his ring. He pours in the green powder. The thunder churns, growing nearer. 

Lightning flashes and thunder booms simultaneously, as our camera zooms out to reveal Pecand’s evil smile for the first time. He watches the green smoke snakes form, then turns and quickly exits frame. 

Pecand exits to the hallway as the smoke snakes grow ever more powerful. 

Cut to medium shot of the incense burner with the snakes growing out and head- ing right for the camera. Our camera pulls back toward the King’s POV, backing away from the snakes, but they’re too fast. They overtake the camera, filling the frame, implying the King’s suffocation. 

The frame begins to clear as the camera spins and turns to reveal the royal ring of the Queen dropping lifeless off the side of the bed. 

Cut to terrace. Fat raindrops pour down now. Lycentia reacts to the rain and heads back inside. 

Cut to high wide angle shot of royal bedroom as the smoke snakes regroup and head for the cradle. Our camera zooms and twists in on the snakes at work, stop- ping on Lycentia in the distance reentering the bedroom from the terrace. Quick rack focus to Lycentia. She sees what’s happened and freezes in the doorway. 

Quick zoom to Lycentia’s horror-stricken reaction. As she glances down at the child, the camera pulls out to show her instinctively shield the child. 

Cut back to the previous shot of the snakes at work as the camera assumes the snakes’ POV. It quickly dollies along inside the bedroom wall, shooting out the bedroom windows, following Lycentia as she runs across the terrace and down the stairs. The camera stops as Lycentia disappears behind distant object.

Fade in on Fahrmans’ farm in the distance. It’s a beautiful spring evening, foreground birds are singing, the sun is low. As we hold on this scene, a beggar (Pecand in disguise) walks on-screen, then down the hill to the farm. We can’t see his face. As he passes, the singing birds scatter… 

Torin’s father calls from behind the barn, “Torin… Touring?” As he rounds the corner of the barn, he mutters, “NOW where is he?” Torin enters over the roof of the house. He does some fancy acrobatics, landing in the front yard with a grin. 

His father sighs, “Torin, when are you going to grow up?” 

Torin looks dejected as his father continues: “Did you pick up those tools from town like I told you?”

Torin heads up the trail onto the bridge and directly into the camera. He appears to be talking to himself. “This is not what I want in life.” 

A pause, then, “I should be a hero.” 

Another pause, and again, “Heroes don’t run errands!” 

Now he’s on the bridge. Another pause. “Right, Boogle?” 

No response. He stops walking. “Boogle?” he asks questioningly. He pokes in his pack. “BOOGLE!” he shouts. “Asleep again?”  

Boogle pokes his head out of Torin’s pack, half in the bag. Torin and Boogle exit shot. 

Torin walks up the hill with Boogle half in the bag, discouraged: “Oh, Boogle. Is this all my life will ever be? Running errands to this little town?”  

Torin comes into C. U. over the hill. Torin, disgusted: “I just don’t want to live my life without ever having lived my life!” 

Suddenly, the sky lights up with a flash of light, and Boogle dives back into the pouch. Torin spins around to face home. 

Cut to CU reverse. We see a look of terror on his face, lit with the green glow.

Pecand is barely visible behind barrel. Scene and music calm down slightly. 

Torin enters scene, crosses to door, enters house, cries out in disbelief: “NO! They never hurt anyone! What happened?” 

Pecand, in disguise, rises from behind the barrel, crosses to left of front door, his voice shaking with phony fear: “I saw it. I saw everything!” 

Torin exits house, looks at Pecand: “Who are you? What are you doing here?” 

Pecand: “I was just passing by when all that started. I was so scared, I hid behind that barrel.”  

Torin, ignoring Pecand: “Who could have done this?” 

Pecand: “It must have been one powerful sorcerer.” Softer: “Or sorceress!” Torin, ignoring Pecand: “Why? And who around here has such power?” 

Pecand: “No one I know.” Pauses, then: “But once there was such a per- son…but, no, Lycentia’s been gone for years.”  

Now Pecand has his attention. Torin: “Lycentia? Who’s Lycentia?” 

Pecand: “Oh, I don’t think it could possibly be her. She was banished to The Lands Below years ago!” 

Torin: “The Lands Below! She must have been evil to be sent there!” Pecand: “Yes. And there’s no way you could ever find her down there!” 

Torin pauses, then sets his resolve. “I know what I’ll do. I’ll find this Lycen- tia and force her to release my parents!” He turns away and exits frame to right. 

Pecand turns left finally revealing evil face and exits frame toward camera. Pecand, under his breath, sarcastically: “I’m sure you will.” 

Pecand is gone. Torin is standing near the woodpile, at the starting point of game. 

And thus the game begins…

Return to the slug tree. Click the scum on the ground below the slugs. Click the Boogle interface icon to display all the available Boogle verbs in the Inventory area. Use the Boogle box on the scum on the ground. Boogle walks to the proper location and forms a box with his tongue as the prop. If you leave the area, Boogle remains in position until you solve this puzzle. 

As you walk away from Boogle, the slugs work their  way  down  the  tree  and  eventually  under  the Boogle box to enjoy the moat scum. When they’re all under there, Boogle falls on the slugs, Torin walks over, collects the slugs, and Boogle reforms to his old self.

An  extremely  long,  establishing  shot  of Palace City, stretching across a large valley (picture Monu- ment Valley filled with crystal-capped mountains).

A medium shot, from a fairly low angle looking up at the drawbridge and guard’s post from the other side of the moat. The drawbridge is always up. Re- gardless of the names you call Zax, the guard, he re- fuses to lower the drawbridge or let you in. The water level of the moat is far enough below eye level that we can’t see it directly, nor the monsters swimming in it. 

If you enter the moat, we see you fall over the edge and go behind a bush so we can see a splash and a water spout but no blood and gore. We hear you groan  and  a  few  crunching  sounds.  We  see  some sucker-covered tentacles whip around from the madly chewing croctopus. EndGame. 

Place the snails (on their leaf) in the moat to re- ceive the moat scum from the croctopus.

One particular bush here is covered with bright berries.  Click  on  them  and  we  see  you  take  all  of them  from  the  bush.  They’re  added  to  Inventory, where you have to look at them to learn they’re called “chuckberries.” Once you pick them, you can’t pick more. 

This scene hosts several examples of the “razor vine”  plant,  a  thick  vine  whose  stem  is  lined  with razor-sharp blades. It has blades on the inner surfaces of its loops. If you click the vine’s hot spot; we see ego  gingerly  reach  over,  touch  the  razor  blades, comment on their sharpness and mention the need to be careful around them. 

At the rear of this scene, behind the razor vine, is an opening in the brush. You carefully climb through the center of the loop to get past the razor vine and into that area. Enter that opening and go to the Pile of Leaves C. U. below. 

A tree here has slugs crawling up and down its trunk. Their position is directly proportional to ego’s distance from the base of the trunk, hopefully at a 1- pixel to 1-pixel ratio. As he approaches the tree, the slugs climb the trunk in unison. As he walks away from  the  tree,  they  climb  back  down  in  unison. There’s no way he can reach them without help. 

If you click on them before feeding them, you get a helpful message, whether you’ve talked to Herman or not. 

If you click on them after feeding them, you only hear munching and crunching sounds. 

If you click on them after they’ve finished eating, you  overhear  them  say,  “I’m  ready  for  a  long  nap now” as they head up the tree to disappear. 

If you place the moat scum on the ground at the base of the tree, they still behave the same, but this time,  when  you’re  across  the  scene,  they  eat  your scum.  But  evidently  you gave them so much scum that  they  can’t  ever  get  enough,  because  you  can leave them there as long as you want before capturing them. 

However, if you check out Boogle’s verb collec- tion by clicking on the Boogle icon in the interface, you notice one of his actions is Boogle-in-the-shape- of-a-box. The answer is then obvious: click the moat scum on the ground at the base of the tree, we see you 

place  it  there,  then  you  select  the  box  icon  from Boogle’s collection, and click it on Boogle. Boogle runs to where you placed the scum, forms himself into a box, forms his tongue into a stick, and places him- self over the “delicious” moat scum. Now, when you walk far enough away, the slugs come down, attack the moat scum as before, but as soon as they’re all below Boogle, he drops on top of them to prevent their escape. Boogle then remains here until you pick him up. 

If Boogle is waiting for the slugs to reach him, and you click him, he just winks at you. 

Once Boogle has trapped the slugs, you can then click him. We see Torin walk over to Boogle, reach under  him,  grab  the  slugs,  and  place  them  in  his pouch.  Add  them to Inventory. Score. Boogle then transforms back to himself.

Here is a screenful of leaves, which all look ap- proximately the same size. They’re all in the shape of a  hockey  rink,  with  interesting  vein  markings  for hockey. 

There’s no way you could tell which leaf is the largest without some measuring device. So you pass the  inchworm  around  the  screen  over  the  leaves. Every time you pause, it says, “no” or “nope” or “17 smirgs”  or  “321  divirs”  or  one  of  twenty  variants, until you are over the largest leaf’s feature, at which time it spouts an enthusiastic “yes!” 

But the joke is on you. As you put away your inchworm, a gust of wind comes along and scatters the leaves again. Now you must find the largest leaf a second time. (Hint: it’s near the middle of the scene.) When you do, as you put away your inchworm, the same thing happens again. Hunt for it a third time and you find it near the left edge of the screen. This time, before you can click to put away your inchworm, we see a big Torin foot come into the pic from the left and hold the leaves in place while a big Torin hand reaches down to pick it up. Add leaf to Inventory. Upon raising your foot, you see the inchworm, spread flat. “Boogle! Peel this off my foot?” He does, shakes the inchworm, who is none the worse, and then grants his freedom in the leaves. You then, also, “leave” this scene, never to return again.

There is a vague opening at the right rear of this scene to provide access to the Woods Bog, below. 

Most of this pic is taken up by the “bridge tree,” a large tree that is easy for ego cross, but every time he does we play a cute piece of animation showing him climbing under the roots, swinging and “surfing” down a rear root. 

This is the home of the twin figure-sliming snails, Slim & Slime. To talk to them, climb only part-way up the bridge tree. If you then click on them, we go to the Snail Talk C. U. below. 

&)  1

Slim & Slime will talk to you and tell you they want to go to the figure sliming contest at the Moat Olympics,  but  first they need a new figure sliming leaf. But not just any leaf, it must be the biggest leaf in the forest. 

“I really enjoy bog scum,” says one. Another re- sponds, “Ahh, you can keep that bog scum. It’s pond scum for me.” A third says, “Perhaps. But I hear the greatest scum of all is…moat scum!” There is a rum- ble of agreement. 

If you click on them a second time before feeding them, they chat again among themselves. “You know, once you go moat, you’ll never go back!” 

We’ll do a Dragnet dialogue, but with S words, including  slug,  snail,  slime,  sliming,  scum,  sliding, slipping,  stolen,  steal,  snack,  snag,  snatch,  sneeze, safely, sleuth, slick, slide, slip, slinky, sly, slob, slosh, slow, slush and…

A tree here has a square root sticking up out of the ground, dead, drying. If you haven’t taken it, you can. Score.

The center of this scene is filled by an ancient peat bog. Peat moss is everywhere, but if you walk out onto it, you slowly sink in over your head. End- Game. 

Nearby  stands  a  large  tree  with  reasonably- climbable branches extending out over the peat moss. If you click on it, you climb the tree. Score. 

Once you’re on the large tree limb that extends out over the bog, you have several more options. If you haven’t tied the rope to yourself, you can click on the ground and climb down. 

If you are up the tree and the rope is not tied to the tree and you click the rope on yourself, you tie the rope to your ankles and it dangles there. 

If the rope is dangling from your ankles and you click on the “climb down” area, you untie the rope first, then climb down. 

But, if the rope is dangling from your ankles and you click on the bog, you do a swan dive head-first into the peat, with the rope flailing above you, fol- lowed by a slow “sinking-into-quicksand” animation. EndGame. (‘You seem to be “bogged down,” Torin.’) 

If the rope is dangling from your ankles and you re-select the rope from Inventory, then click the rope on the branch, you tie the rope to the branch. You can also do this in reverse: tie the rope to the branch, re- select it from Inventory, then click the rope on your- self to tie it to your ankles. 

If you are on the ground and click the rope on the limb, the limb is inactive. 

If you are up the tree and the rope is tied to the tree and you click on the rope, we see you maneuver down onto the rope in a normal, right-side-up posi- tion. You can then maneuver up and down the rope. If you click on the peat moss, you maneuver to the bot- tom of the rope, try to reach it, but fail. Close, no cigar. 

But, if the rope is tied to both the tree limb and yourself and you click on the bog, we see you dive off the branch, bounce down to the peat moss, automati- cally  grab  a  handful,  then  slowly  bounce  to  a  full stop, hanging upside down from your “bungee.” Add the peat to Inventory. Score. 

Now you are hanging upside-down suspended by the ankles. If you click on the branch overhead, we see you struggle and twist trying to reach the rope, but fail to do so. 

At this point, you must make Torin swing back and forth through judicious clicking near his body. Clicking  in  front  of  your  body  when  your  body  is going  that  direction  adds  velocity.  Clicking  behind your body subtracts velocity. Think of swinging on a swing and “stretching or reaching” for power. (This code exists in Freddy Pharkas, Frontier Pharmacist, when Freddy’s on the swing set in the schoolyard.) 

At your farthest swing to the left, there are two cells when you can click the “lesser” branch conven- iently placed nearby, and swing to safety, just as the rope unties from your leg and the tree and plummets into the bog. Score. 

If  you’re  swinging  upside  down  and  click  the rope on yourself, you reach up, untie the rope from your feet and fall into the bog. (This animation al- ways begins from the center cel and you only back and forth 3 cells. Therefore, if Torin is hanging still, start him swinging until he’s moving 3 cells each way. If he’s swinging more than 3 cells, slow him until he’s moving 3 cells worth, then start the untie animation.) 

If you are holding onto the lesser branch, you can then select the rope in Inventory and click it on your- self to untie it from your foot. The rope swings back under the upper branch as you swing to the ground and freedom. 

If you do anything else while holding the lesser branch, you turn loose of the branch and return to swinging upside down by the rope.

A curious old shack is built right near a tall cliff, directly  in  front  of  a  palatial,  but  run-down,  small building.  The  shack  looks  uninhabited,  but  isn’t. There are many green crystal shards growing out of the ground here, ripe for the taking. To take one, you must have the ax from the barn to break it off. 

If  you  click  on  a  crystal,  we  show  you  try  to break it off, but you can’t. 

You can ask Boogle to do it. He’s able to form an ax. If you try him or the ax on any crystal, we go to the Crystal Breaking CU below. 

The door to the guard’s house is locked until you break off and take one of the green crystal shards. 

If you break off a crystal in the CU below, we re- turn to this shot to see the guard rush from his shack to confront you He’s more than a little confused. (Pic- ture  Grandpa  Simpson  with  a  weapon.)  Since  he’s never seen anyone come from town out to see him, he naturally assumes you came from The Lands Below. You argue back and forth a little, but soon you realize that’s you way through: convince him you are from below and he’ll have to send you “back” down there. You both enter his hut now. 

 0)  1

If you try the Boogle ax on a crystal, you get: “Boogle,  can  you  make  an  ax?”  you  ask.  Boogle promptly makes an X and looks at you proudly and expectantly.  “Not  an  X,  an  ax!”  you  exclaim.  He makes the ax, you click him on the crystal, you swing him,  he  hits  it  and  it  hurts  him!  Little  cartoon  of Boogle hopping about in pain. 

If you use the ax on the crystal, we see you swing the ax, break off a hunk of green crystal, and pocket it as Herman, awakened by your racket, comes out of the house holding his weapon—aimed right at you!

Herman  is  mentally  confused.  Sometimes  he thinks you’re from The Lands Above, sometime from The  Lands  Below.  When  you’re  from  The  Lands Above he insists you stay for dinner, implying “as my guest.” Later you learn what that really means is “fix me my dinner!” But other times, when he thinks you really are from The Lands Below, he wants you to “just play along, okay?” Other times he’s lucid. He even provides background on the phenocryst concept. (He’s lonely.) 

Clicking  him  before  serving  him  gives,  “I’m thirsty. Can you fix me some juice?” 

You bring the chuckberries from the woods to his kitchen  and  use  them  on  his  kitchen  cabinet  berry smasher  to  squash  them  into  juice  (while  duck- walking across the floor to a hot guitar solo), grab a glass, fill it, as you ask, “Say, what kind of berries are these?” As you serve him, he says, “Why, chuckber- ries, of course.” (Drum fill.) 

If you use the chuckberries on the kitchen before he  asks  for  it,  he  suggests,  “That  looks  good  for later.” 

“Now  I’m  hungry.  I’d  love  some  ‘Slugetti  & Peatballs’ like my mother used to make!” “Spaghetti 

- meatballs?” you ask. “What’s that?” he responds. “Say…you sure you’re from around here?” he asks suspiciously. “Slugetti and peatballs!” 

  You bring the slugs from the forest and the peat moss you grabbed from the bog to his kitchen cabinet and use them on his pots to prepare him “Slugetti & Peatballs.” As you serve it to him, he says, “This is good, but I sure could use some dessert. A little root pie would sure hit the spot.” (“Geez,” you think, “no wonder nobody eats with this guy!”)?” 

  If you use the slugs or the peat on the kitchen be- fore he asks for it, he suggests, “That looks good for later.” 

  If you use the slugs or the peat on the kitchen when you don’t have the other in Inventory, he sug- gests, “Peat is good, but not without slugs.” And vice versa. 

  You bring the “square root” from the woods to the kitchen and use it on his kitchen cabinet to pre-

  pare a pie, then start it baking in his oven. “Mmmmm, smells delicious!” he says. “To me, there’s nothing as satisfying as coming home to find ‘square root pie!’” (Drum fill.) 

  If you use the root on the kitchen before he asks for it, he suggests, “That looks good for later.” 

  In return for all of that, he tells you “While that’s cooking,  sonny,  follow  me.  I’ve  got  something  to show you.” Then he insists upon sending you back down.  He  pulls  the  kitchen  cabinet  away  from  the wall, revealing a doorway. He leads you into it to find The Portal Down, below.

  Here’s  the  gist  of  the  conversations  between Herman and Torin. 

  *Conversation 1, Outside after breaking crystal* 

  Herman: Hey, waddaya think you’re doing there? Trying to sneak by me? I wasn’t asleep, NO sir! I heard you come through! 

  Torin: Oh, no, sir. I wasn’t trying to sneak any- where. Truth is, I’m searching for Lycentia, the evil sorceress. From The Lands Below. Have you heard of her? 

  Herman: The Lands Below? That’s where you’re from? Well, you can’t stay here. You have to go back down there. Right away. Yep. That’s why I’m here. Nobody’s  come  up  from  down  there  while  I’m  on duty. No, sir! Not in the last fifteen years, sonny! 

  Torin: NO, no. You misunderstood. I’m not from The Lands Below! I want to go there. Do you know how to get there? 

  Herman: Go there? No, no one goes there! That’s no  place  for  any  self-respectin’  citizen!  Why  them worlds  is  filled  with  nutso!  Malcontents!  Psycho! Politicians! No way will I send you down there! 

  Torin: You know how to get to The Lands Be- low?! Oh, please. Tell me. May I come inside? It’s very important. 

  Herman: No. We can’t. No, you can’t. In fact, no one  gets  inside  my  guardhouse,  except  the  my  re- placement. Don’t know where he is, either. Was sup- posed to be here 10, maybe 12 years ago! He’s never been THIS late before! Gotta go. Don’t come back. Ain’t sending nobody to no Lands Below. Haven’t in years. Won’t either. Bye. 

And he walks inside the house. 

*Conversation 2, after Torin knocks* 

Herman (through door): Halt! Who goes there? 

Torin: It’s me, Torin. (bluffing) Uh, I’m your re- placement. 

Herman:  Well,  it’s  about  time.  Where’ve  ya been? You must be about 10 years late! 

Torin: Heavy traffic. 

Herman: Huh? Whatever. Hurry up and get in- side here. I’m hungry. 

Torin: Uh, okay. (He enters.) 

Herman: (under breath) Can’t say I care much for the new uniforms! 

*Conversation 3, inside guardhouse* 

Herman: Well? Get started. 

Torin: Okay. (Pause) Started what? 

Herman:  Don’t  they  teach  you  young’uns  any- thing at Basic? 

Torin: Well, maybe, but, uh, I wasn’t at the top of my class you know… 

Herman: I can see that! Doesn’t tradition mean anything  anymore?  What’s  this  younger  generation coming to? Where’s your provisions? 

Torin: Provisions? I, uh… 

Herman: My meal, boy! The replacement guard always cooks the departing guard his last meal before taking over! 

Torin: Why, uh, yeah. That’s still taught to all of “us.” What’ll you have? 

Herman:  You  mean  you  didn’t  bring  anything with you? Well, you won’t find no home fort com- forts out here. Your problem, not mine. I know what I want. 

Torin: So? What can I fix you for your last meal? 

Herman: Last meal? I ain’t dead yet! Who are you? What are you doing in here? 

Torin: I’m your replacement. It’s time for you to leave. Do you want a meal or not? 

Herman:  Course.  Wouldn’t  have  it  any  other way. For my appetizer this evening, I believe I’ll be- gin light: just a small glass of berry juice, boy. You can use that juicer on the counter there. 

Torin: Okay. 

Hold  at  this  state  until  user  clicks  berries  on 

juicer. 

*Conversation 4: pre-berries on juicer* 

Torin: Berries? That’s what you want? 

Herman:  What’s  the  matter  with  you?  Senile? Squeeze me some juice! I’m ready to go home. (If I can remember where home is!) 

*Conversation 5: berries on juicer* 

Torin:  Here  ya  go,  Sergeant.  Berries.  Just like you asked. Just let me squeeze them for you… 

(Dances around floor to Chuck Berry music.) 

Torin (giving juice to Herman): Say! What kind of berries are those? 

Herman (drinks first, then): Why, Chuck berries, of  course!  (Pause.)  But,  now  I’m  hungry.  I  want slugetti and peatballs, just like ma ol’ mammy used ta make. 

Torin: Slugetti and peatballs? Don’t you mean, spaghetti and meatballs? 

Herman: Where you from, boy? You sure you’re from around here? You’re not from The Lands Be- low,  are  you?  Course  not!  I  want  the  real  thing: slugetti and peatballs! 

*Conversation 6: pre-slugs & peat* 

Torin reconfirms meal. 

*Conversation 7: slugs & peat on pots* 

Torin bitches about how tough it was to get the peat moss from the bog. Herman orders dessert 

*Conversation 8: pre-square root* 

Torin reconfirms meal. 

*Conversation 9: square root on pots* 

Torin hopes this is the end of his meal. Herman agrees, “And while it’s in the over, come on with me. I show you around the place.” Leads them both to Phenocryst  Chamber.  Herman  tells  Torin  “pick  a shard.” “Now I’m outta here, boy. My tour’s over. I’m gonna take my pie and hit the road. You’re on your own. Whatever you do, don’t let anybody from The Lands Below in through that Phenocryst!” 

   

Behind  the  guardhouse  is  the  formerly  palatial Portal Chamber that can now only be entered through the  guard’s  kitchen  cabinet.  It  covers  the  very phenocryst  where  Lycentia  was  sent  down  to  The Lands Below those many years ago. (Of course, since 

the player hasn’t seen that flashback yet, this will all be news to him.) 

The phenocryst column is a pale sandstone color, indicating the land where it concludes. 

The room is circular, with the six-foot wide en- trance carpet (tile pattern) leading directly to the hex- agonal podium, which is also six feet per edge. At the rear of the room the walls end unevenly at the bare stone  sandstone  cliff.  This  cliff  contains  the  actual phenocryst column, which is outlined with the hexa- gon shape. When you enter, the podium consists of four large sculptural rock columns rising out of the floor, effectively blocking much of the crystal. At the “two o’clock” position, a large stone console is lo- cated near the wall. This is the control panel for the podium’s rock shafts. At ten o’clock, an elaborate tile pattern in the floor will open up as soon as you solve the crystal puzzle, so the “eressdy Powder Font” can rise up. 

There has to be an artificial lamp here, so Boogle can explore it, then add it to his Boogletory. 

Once you have a shard, clicking it on the console takes you to the Crystal Console MS below. 

The Guard waits around during all this, without saying a word. Perhaps he’s asleep. 

Once you have lowered all four stones to form the transmitting stage, the Eressdy Font is extended to its up position. Then if you click on it, we go to the Eressdy Font C. U. below. 

) &  1

When  you enter, Herman opens a velvet-lined, form-fitting  drawer  filled  with  different  crystals. “Pick a shard…any shard!” he proclaims. “Hee hee!” he pops, “I’ve been waitin’ fifteen years to use that line!” You can select any one, they’re all the same. Score. You return from this C. U. to the main room scene, above. 

   2 &

This shot shows a C. U. of the console in the foreground, the four-part podium of stone columns in the  midground,  and  the  phenocryst  column  in  the background (not necessarily lined up). 

The console has four holes, each a perfect fit for your shard. (The green shard you broke off out in his front yard does not fit.) Each hole emits colored light, namely  from  left  to  right:  Red,  Green,  Blue,  and White. When you insert your clear shard in the Red,

Green, or Blue sockets, some of the rocks slowly and noisily  change position (they lower if up, and vice versa) per the table below. When you insert the shard in  the  White  socket  (i.e.,  on  mouseUp),  the  white socket becomes red and all the other colors shift left one position. In addition, each hole’s effect on the rocks is shifted left one position. 

We begin with all four rocks in the Up position and the lights in Pattern A. See the chart on the right to find out what happens under each condition. 

When  all  four  columns  finally  reach  the  down position, we see the Eressdy Font rise up out of the floor to its full glory, then we automatically take you from this screen back to the full room shot above, never to return. The crystal shard the Guard gave you remains in the console.

The Eressdy Font is like a baptism or holy water font, except it contains a yellowish powder. If you have the tobacco pouch, you can click it on the font to receive enough powder to take you down and back on the ol’ Eressdy highway.

Map of Region 2, Escarpa 

The first of the inner worlds resembles the U. S. desert Southwest, with lots of stone, red rocks, painted desert, vertical cliffs, scrubby trees growing out of cracks in the vertical walls. Since we’re still near the surface, you can see the outer land and its green forests far above us through holes in the surface. It is a dry climate, with barely enough water to support a few scrubby desert plants. Vines are the only connection from one side of the cliff to the other. (Picture Grand Canyon from the inside looking up.) A few thin wispy clouds float here and there, inside the surface lid below the upper crust. 

This region centers on a 6-screen vertical scroller, and the rooms are named by their relationship to it, from Cliff 1 at the top to 6 at the bottom. The scroller’s two cliff faces are labeled E and W. Interiors off the scroller are labeled R or L. Therefore: 2R is a separate room off the right side of Cliff 2. 2E is the cliff face on the east side of Cliff 2 

The natives here are low-lying, compact, and hairy. (Picture Yoda with thicker fur.) This provides lots of con- trast from the people of The Lands Above and from the Pergolans of the next level. It also means wherever Torin goes inside, he scrapes the ceiling and must stoop to get through doors, walk bent over, etc. 

Here we first learn about Leenah, Torin’s love interest. (The love part is seriously down-played in this game, but should provide material for a sequel.) The big Leenah joke is: everyone here speaks of Leenah as ideal for Torin, but in an off-hand, slighting way, because…well, how can they come out and say, “we have a princess who is nearly as ugly as you!” Whenever Torin asks anyone about her, the locals respond, “she has a nice personality,” or “she’s so polite,” or “she’s a lot of fun,” or “she’s very good to her parents.” So, when Torin finally sees her (captured by the Pergolans in Level 3, below), he understands why everyone has been hedging: she’s gorgeous, a long-haired, long- legged beauty about Torin’s age, with a distinctive look, perhaps like a quasi-Oriental Elle MacPherson. Tia Carrera, but even more so. And, if you were a furry Yoda, that would be ugly! 

There are nine square abstract geometric tiles scattered throughout this level. You must collect all nine tiles to solve the Phenocryst Phace puzzle and go on to Pergola, World 3. 

Skinny steps with 1” treads connect the rocky platforms outside the caves in which the people live. Throughout this region, if you click on air (i.e., miss the rocks and instruct the game to walk you off a cliff), you walk to the cliff edge nearest the click, teeter a few cycles, recover with a “Whew!” and then just stand still at the cliff’s edge.

Enter  dramatically  by  falling  into  1W  from above, grabbing the bush, then falling out of 1W to 2W. Pick up the tile that almost kills you. That’s Tile #1. 

Climb  up  the  tiny  steps  to  1W.  Take  Tile  #2. (You’re standing on it!) Fall again into 2W. 

Enter the cave beside you. Talk to the Bitternuts. Learn they’re bitter about never being invited to the King’s parties. (Notice they’re nuts!) Watch Boogle. Don’t leave until he’s learned about yo-yo’s and fire- place shovels. 

Cross the canyon to 2E. Enter the King’s cham- ber, 2R. Talk to the King. Notice the wall behind him has a rainbow of colored shards, except he’s missing green. Give him the green shard you brought from the guardhouse’s front yard back in The Lands Above. Make a pretentious speech about world peace. Get an invitation to the Royal Ball. Bow to the King. See the tile mounted on his floor. (If you try to take it, the King asks you what you’re going to use it for. If you haven’t seen the Phenocryst Phace, you have no use in mind. If you have, he’ll give it to you.) On your way out, stop off at the buffet table and grab the roast leg-O’-meat. 

Return to the Bitternuts. Give them the Royal In- vitation. Take their trivet. That’s Tile #3. 

Climb down 2W to 3W. Grab a clothespin from the clothesline vine. 

Climb down to 4W and enter 4L, the dragon’s lair. Take the door at the rear of the cave—that’s your Tile #4. Switch to the Boogletory. Use Boogle as a inchworm. When he’s completely inside, change him to a lamp. The cave lights up inside and you discover the  dragon  poo.  Use  Boogle  as  the  long-handled 

scoop. Boogle does a long take, looking straight at you with an “Oh, no!” expression. The light in his eyes goes out. We hear Boogle slurp and muck about in the poo. Click on Boogle to pull him out. Add the poo to Inventory. 

Leave the cave and drop the leg-O’-meat into the hole in the rock. See the vultures get distracted and fly away? Now you can climb down to 5W and take a vine to 4E. Climb down 4E to 5E. Enter 5R, the sera- glio. Take the tabletop for Tile #5 of your collection. Take a pillow from the pile. Take a carpet from the floor.  Take  a  feathered  fan.  Grab  the  danger  sign. Look at it in Inventory. Click on it. Realize it’s a tile too. Actually, it’s not two, but tile #6. 

Climb up 5E to 4E. Enter skunk cave until you are near the skunks’ nest. “Listen, Boogle! Do you smell something?” You can’t get close enough to get sprayed. Boogle refuses to go too. Put the clothespin on your nose. It’s now a standoff…until you throw the carpet on the skunks. They squirt it, and run off out the back of the cave. (Who knew it had a back door!?) 

Leave the cave, climb down to 6E’s upper bal- cony. Use the horizontal scroll button to scroll the picture all the way to the right. See the small, hairy women  naked  in  the  mineral  baths.  Listen  to  them complain  about  various  odors.  Drop  the  stench- drenched carpet onto the ledge below you. Use the feathered fan to move the aroma into the cave. See the odalisques run out the back door. 

Return to 5R. Go to the ladder. Use the vertical scroll button to scroll the picture all the way down. Click the clothespin on Boogle. Switch to the Boogle- tory,  and  use  the  yo-yo  on  the  ladder.  You  lower Boogle as a yo-yo and “walk the dog” a ways to the west.  Boogle  recovers  and  stands there waiting for instructions. Click the hot tub liner’s hot spot to make Boogle take Tile #7. Click the door’s hot spot to have Boogle leave via the same door through which the odalisques left. We hear a “Fibber McGee’s closet” collection of soundFX, and women’s screams and lots of shrieks until the pic scrolls automatically so we can see  Boogle  emerge  smiling from a stalactite in the ceiling of 5R 

Leave 5R, climb from 5E to 4E, enter 4R, follow the cave until you emerge on cliff 3R. Talk to Veder. Learn dragon poo makes everything green grow much more rapidly. Give him the silk pillow. Get Tile #8. 

Return to 5E. You’re not strong enough to throw the poo all the way over to the tree. But, by using Boogle’s scoop on the dragon poo, you can sling it clear  across  the  chasm  directly  at  the  base  of  the small tree. Watch that tree grow! 

Climb back to 4R. Cross back to 5L on the vine. Climb down to 5L. Now that you can reach the top branches of the tree, climb down it to 6W. Walk to 6L and you’ll enter the Phenocryst Phace place. In- stall at least one of your tiles correctly in the face. 

Climb up and cross over to 2R. Enter the royal chamber again. Talk to the king. You’ll tell him what you’ve found. This time, when you bow before him click on the tile in the floor, and he’ll let you take it, since you’ve expressed a use. That’s Tile #9! Return to 6L, and install all your tiles in the correct manner, rotating them as needed when you place them. After 

all nine are in place, the face becomes a door and opens. 

Enter the phenocryst column chamber. Stand on the platform. Use the eressdy powder. Enjoy Level 3! 

33& 

First time only: Torin enters this scene from The Lands Above by falling out of the horizontal face of a phenocryst column that ends on the bottom of a cliff in the upper-left corner of this pic, landing on a small bush jutting out of the left side of the cliff, which holds his weight just long enough to be funny, after which it slowly creaks and breaks so he falls off the bottom of this screen to 2W. We then automatically scroll down to 2W, wait 3 seconds, hear another fal- ling sound and Tile CB drops in vertically, burying itself in the sand mere inches from Torin’s skull. Near miss! But, don’t worry—he’s okay. 

If Tile LC hasn’t been taken, it’s here being used as a step. When Torin enters from 2W, his entrance script stops him on it. If he takes it, we show him reach down, pull it out from under his feet, lose his balance,  and  fall  off-screen,  after  which  we  scroll back down into 2W again to find him in the same pose as above. 

33& 

First  time  only:  We  automatically  scroll  here from 1W, wait 3 seconds, hear another falling sound and Tile LC drops in vertically, burying itself in the sand mere inches from Torin’s skull. Near miss! But, don’t worry—he’s okay. 

You can take Tile LC. If you don’t, it’ll be here when you return. 

If you haven’t taken the tile from 1W above, you can climb the canyon wall to Cliff 1W. There are toe- and fingertip-holds carved in the sheer rock face here that will lead back to 1W. Switch to the toe and fin- gertip “climber” animation and move him to 1W. See above. 

If Torin just took Tile LC from 1W above, we scroll down to find him lying in the sand exactly as above, but this time no tile comes falling in near his head. He waits a while, gets up, shrugs, and is okay. But once you take the tile from 1W, you can’t climb back up there again. 

You can climb down the West cliff to 4W. You cannot climb the East cliff to anywhere. 

A cave in the west wall leads to 2L, The Bitter-

nuts. 

There are several vines crossing the canyon, but only one that you can traverse. It leads from the west cliff to the Throne Room entrance on the right cliff. 

After dismounting the vine, you can walk East into the Throne Room, Cliff 2R. 

6 0 

This low-ceilinged cave is the home of the Bit- ternut family—who are either bitter or nuts or both. But they have a trivet that looks just like the tile you found outside and you suspect they might trade it for something. The room needs a fireplace, kitchen and a dining table. 

The  family  consists  of  Mr.  &  Mrs.  &  Bobby, their son. Mrs. does all the talking. Mr. never talks. Bobby stands and plays with his yo-yo. 

First time in: Boogle explores Bobby, learning how to be a yo-yo. 

First time in: after Boogle has explored Bobby and learned how to be a yo-yo, he heads for the fire- place and learns how to be a scoop. 

After  a  little  (strange)  conversation,  you  learn they’ve never been invited to any of the royal func- tions—and the King lives right across the hole! 

If  you  give  them  your  Royal  Ball  Invitation, they’ll offer you the run of their home with a frenzied, “Go ahead! Take everything!” they scream. But “you only have the hots (spot)” for the trivet, so you take it. Later  you  use  it  as  Tile  C  in  the  center  of  the Phenocryst Phace. 

They  bitterly  mention  Princess  Leenah,  who hasn’t even invited them over and she’s lived here all her life! But, after all, she’s as polite as she is attrac- tive. 

46 4

This cave has a very low-ceiling, and you must walk  stooped  when  in  it.  There  is  a  banquet  table filled with goodies, including a large “leg-O’-meat” for you to take. A royal throne rests against one wall, directly under a mural with a near-rainbow created by directing light from a clear crystal that’s part of the cave wall onto six colored crystal shards in this order: OYGBIV. There’s an obvious opening on the left for a  red  shard.  Before  the  throne,  there’s  an  obvious pattern of tiles on the floor with one tile in the center 

the tile we’re trying to get away from the King. King Rupert  and  Queen  Di  sit  on  their  thrones,  being fanned by two husky hairy women. 

Because of the low-ceiling, you have to enter the cave bowed over. Doing so impresses King Rupert. with your humility. When you talk to him, he enters into  a  long  conversation  with  you.  You  tell  him you’re passing through looking for Lycentia of The Lands Below. He says, “if you find my, ahem, lovely daughter, let me know. You two have much in com- mon. (Ahem.)” 

If you give the King the red crystal shard you took  outside  the  guard’s  hut,  you  make  a  speech about how important this is to your world and how you hope it will be the start of a new world of trade 

between your countries. The old boy buys it. In re- turn, he gives you an invitation to the Royal Ball, to be held in two weeks. 

The King mentions it’s been years since the last vine giving access to The Lands Below broke. While the Escarpians always got along well with the lower people, they haven’t heard anything from The Lands Above in years. There is a short discussion RE cur- rent conditions above and below. 

As you “take your leave,” you bow fully before the king and queen and we switch to a C. U. of the floor at your feet. There is a significant tile mounted right in the floor of the throne room, directly in front of  the  king.  A  twinkle  passes  over  it,  for  those dumber than dirt. You may try to take it now, but if you  haven’t  placed  any  of  the  other  tiles  on  the Phenocryst Phace, the King refuses your request. So you just leave, for now, knowing you need to return to fetch that tile. 

Once  you’ve  placed  at  least  one  tile  on  the Phenocryst  Phace,  you  can  return  here.  You  chat again, and when you bow to leave, the tile is again hot. If you click it then, we return from the C. U. to see you give your explanation to the King. He’s ex- cited about regaining access to The Lands Below and orders you to take the tile. 

The Queen now “is hot” for you (i.e., she has a hot spot). Clicking her, she gives you a locket for you to give to Leenah as a recognition that you represent the royal family. If you try to leave the room without it, she stops you and gives it to you anyway, but you don’t get the points. 

4 +  1

When you bow before the king in the previous L. S., we switch to this C. U. of the floor at your feet. 

There is a significant tile mounted right in the floor of the throne room, directly in front of the king. A twin- kle passes over it, for those dumber than dirt. You may try to take it now, but if you haven’t placed any of the other tiles on the Phenocryst Phace, the King refuses your request. 

Once  you’ve  placed  at  least  one  tile  on  the Phenocryst Phace and you click the hot tile here, we return from the C. U. to hear you offer your explana- tion of why you need this particular tile. He relents. 

33& 

There is a vine used for drying laundry (“Hey, look  Boogle.  A  clothesvine!”)  which  contains  no clothing  but  does  have  a  few  clothespins  hanging there. You can take one clothespin. 

You can climb down the west cliff and exit out the lower-left corner. This scrolls you to 4W. 

At the east edge of this screen, Veder is meditat- ing, sitting on a painfully uncomfortable rock stool. Since there’s no vine across the canyon here, to get to him you must go down to 5W, take the cross-canyon vine to 4E, enter Skunk Cave, get past the skunks, follow the cave around until you find the exit. Presto. There you are at Veder’s little balcony here on 3E. 

If  you  are  on  3E  and  exit  right,  you  re-enter Skunk Cave. 

When you finally get to him, Veder turns out to be a prophet, a seer, a sage, a wise man of the village, and a comic with bad timing. His problem? He’s de- veloping severe lower-back pains (i.e., hemorrhoids) from  sitting  on  his  uncomfortable  tiled  rock  stool. “Tiled?”  you  say,  and  ask  to  see  it.  Sure  enough, there’s another tile you want for your collection, Tile UR. You ask for it, but he refuses you. 

If you offer Veder the pillow from the seraglio, he’ll gladly give you Tile UR in trade. His butt will thank you. (No, not literally!) 

Veder drops occasional clues about the macro- organic properties of dragon fertilizer, but in a nice way, of course. 

33&  

There are only two rock balconies here: 4E, in the lower-right corner, and 4W which is mostly walk- able surface. 

From the 4E balcony, a vine leads left and down off-screen. Follow it and you’ll go to the upper-left corner of 5W. 

From the 4E balcony, you can walk east and en- ter Skunk Cave. 

From the 4E balcony, there are some footholds in the stone leading down to 5E. Click on these and you change to your cliff-scaler loop and climb down the scroller to reach the entrance to the seraglio. 

From 4W, you can climb up to 3W. 

By walking west off this screen from 4W, you enter the Dragon’s Cave, 4L. 

4W is really a thin balcony of stone. The outer- most edge of the stone overhangs the cliff below and has a hole completely through it. Use this hole’s hot spot to drop leg-O’-meat past the vultures in 5W be- low. When you do, we auto-scroll the pic down to include the vultures, hear them discuss the possibility of meat falling down right beside them, and see them take off over the edge of the cliff and down, never to reappear  again. We then scroll back up to this pic again, with no more vultures to worry about. 

`  `6  #

This  2-screen-wide  scrolling  cave  gets  consis- tently  smaller  as  you  head  west  until  you  can  just barely reach the farthest west end of it. By stretching completely, and making yourself as thin as possible, you can reach barely Tile UC and take it. You use it in the upper-center of the Phenocryst Phace. 

However, when the tile is removed, a blast of air comes out right in your face, revealing still more pas- sageway yet ahead and emitting a blast of cool air that you comment on. You can see a little ways back into the hole but not enough to tell what’s inside. There’s no way Torin can fit into an even smaller opening. What our poor boy to do? 

Use his Boogle, of course! Boogle has several new  verbs  in  his  collection,  including  yo-yo,  lamp and scoop. Here you turn him into the inchworm and guide  him  into the darkness. As he progresses, the screen scrolls until you are just barely still on the east side of the screen and Boogle is completely in the darkness  of  the  rear  cave.  Once  Boogle  is  inside, change to Boogle’s lamp verb and click it on him. He turns into a lantern and lights the cave interior. We can now see the large pile of dragon poo that nearly fills the cave. (Boogle comments about the quality of his workplace environment.) To retrieve the poo, you 

select Boogle’s shovel function from the Boogletory and click it on him. 

If Boogle is in the poo cave, and you select the shovel  from  Boogletory,  while  you’re  moving  the shovel to him, he gives you a look which leaves no doubt as to his pleasure at the thought of becoming a shit shovel. When you click on him, it goes dark in the cave again, but we hear a icky, sickly soundFX, a Boogle comment, and you get the dragon poo added to  Inventory.  Turn  Boogle  back into the inchworm and he crawls out. If you don’t do this and leave the cave without him, he turns back into himself by him- self and follows you out, but you get no points. 

(“Ah,  Boogle.  You  really  know  how  to  sling the…dragon poo!” Boogle thinks, “What? And give up show biz?”) 

` `46&) ) 

This pic consists of a long snaking passage for you to walk through in a silly, stooped position just so you can get to Veder in Scroller 3E. 

About halfway through the cave, you encounter a pair of skunks. They chat about the downfall of the neighborhood. If you get too close, they threaten to spray  you  and  you  back  off.  You  can’t  get  close enough to get sprayed. Boogle refuses to get close, either. “Listen, Boogle! Do you smell something?” 

When you’re close to the skunks, you can put the clothespin  on  your  nose, but as soon as you move away from them, you remove it. 

You can wave the feathered fan at them, but they just enjoy it. 

But if you throw the carpet on the skunks, they squirt it madly before realizing they’ve wasted their ammo. They then run out the back door of the cave. (Who knew there was a back door!?) 

After the skunks are gone, you can take the car- pet, if you’re wearing your clothespin. 

If you walk all the way through the cave, you emerge on Veder’s balcony on 3E. 

33& !

As soon as you enter this scene from 4W, the vultures attack (without killing you, of course). They peck ferociously. There’s no way past them. But, if you just drop your leg-O’-meat off the launcher ramp in 4W, they’ll be gone from here forever. 

The Cliff at 5W ends in a drop-off. There’s no way for you to continue down any farther. An eyeball hot spot at the bottom of this pic causes us to scroll down to Cliff 6 for a look. But all we see there is a young tree that’s not nearly tall enough to reach the ledge you’re on. Any click, and you scroll right back up to this scene. 

However,  once  you’ve  thrown  the  dragon  poo from 6W onto that tree below you in 6E and the tree grows up, then you can just click on it from here and we see you reach over, grab a branch and climb down to 6W. 

There’s a vine here beyond the vultures, but you can’t get to it while they’re here. Once they’re gone, you can use it to traverse the canyon. It ends on 4E. 

There is a balcony on lower 5E. If you’re on it, you can click on the footholds above it to climb up the rocks to 4E. 

Walk east from 5E and you enter the upper sera- glio, 5R. 

Walk south from 5E and you go to 6E, a balcony in the upper-right corner of the pic. It leads you no- where,  but  it  does  hang  above  the  entrance  to  the lower seraglio, 6R. 

!46 & 

This is where the King’s Harem lives, although we treat the subject lightheartedly, never calling it by that name. When you enter, the area is empty. Tile LL is being used here as the top of a table. You can take the tile for later use as the lower-left corner of the Phenocryst Phace. 

There is a feathered fan leaning against the wall here. You can take it. 

The floor here is covered with a pile of pillows in various royal hues. Click anywhere on the pile and you’ll get the silk harem pillow. 

There is also a red carpet on the floor here that you can take. 

Near the right front corner, there is a ladder that goes straight down through the cave floor. You can see  what’s  below  the  ladder  by  using  the  vertical scroll button to scroll down there, but you can’t get there because the ladder isn’t strong enough to hold your  weight.  If  you  climb  on  it,  you  fall  straight through and out the bottom of this world, amid a long “Homer  Simpson  at  Springfield  Gorge”  soundFX. EndGame. 

If  Boogle  tries  the  same  ladder,  it  is  also  too weak to hold him. He falls straight through and out the bottom of this world, with just a falling soundFX. EndGame. 

In  front  of  the  ladder  there  is  a  bright  yellow diamond warning sign. On your first click, you read the sign. It says, “ladder for lightweights only.” Click it again and you take the sign. Once you have it, you can examine it in Inventory. If you turn it, you realize it’s really Tile UL. 

But if you turn Boogle into a yo-yo, you can yo- yo  him  down  into  the  room  below  from  either  the ladder opening or the exterior cave opening. You then “Walk the Dog” across the room towards the center. See 6R for remainder. 

746 2  0

This is a room you cannot enter, but you can par- ticipate in it and solve its puzzles by using the hori- zontal and vertical scrollers and your Boogle. 

There are a few harem girls hanging around the hot tub-like mineral deposits and mud pots and steam- ing  cauldrons  here.  They  occasionally  talk  about smells, fragrances, aromas, etc. to clue you in to the aromatic nature of this puzzle. 

Since you can do nothing as long as the women are present, you must get them to leave. Enter the 6E balcony.  Drop  the  stench-drenched  carpet  onto  the lower balcony (outside the Mineral Baths). We see the smell enter the Baths and we automatically scroll the picture over to the right (if necessary) so we can see all the Baths (yet keep ego on the screen). The smell of the carpet forces the women to leap up and run from the Baths through the door at the back of the Baths. 

Once this room is empty, the solution is obvious: use Boogle as a yo-yo to go down here from 5R or 5E,  thus  skipping  the weak ladder. But Boogle re- fuses to go because it smells so bad. So you must first click the clothespin on Boogle’s nose. Then he can’t smell the carpet. Now he’s a yo-yo with a clothespin on its nose. 

You use your clothespinned Boogle as a yo-yo, lower him to the mineral baths floor and “walk the dog” towards the baths. 

If  the  women  are  in  the  baths  when  ego  falls through on the ladder, they all stop talking, look at you,  and  when  you’re  gone  and  the  soundFX  are over, resume their chatter again., 

If the women are present when you lower your clothespinned Boogle, one of them waits for him to get there, then punts Boogle out the hole in the floor below the ladder. EndGame. 

But if the Baths are cleared out, you yo-yo him onto  the  floor  and  he  lands,  recovers  his  normal shape, and walks over to the middle of the room. 

watch them fly out of the hot tub, cross the room, and run out the back door. Once Boogle is alone, you can turn him back into himself. Now there is a hot spot on the tiles around the hot tub. Use Boogle to take it. It is Tile R. By now, you should know where to put it! 

When Boogle is down here, the tile has a hot spot so it can be taken. Make Boogle grab a tile. Once it’s taken, Boogle recovers and stands there waiting for instructions. Now the door has a hot spot, so Boogle can leave that way. When he does, we hear a “Fibber McGee’s closet” collection of soundFX, with lots of women’s  screams  and  shrieks  until  the  pic  scrolls automatically back up to 5R so we can see a smiling Boogle emerge from a stalactite in the ceiling of 5R 

33& 7

This is as low as you can go in this level. There are balconies on the upper-right corner and the lower- left. It’s obvious there’s nothing underneath the bal- conies but air. 

A small tree is located on 6W, directly under the cliff in 5W. 

You can enter this scene from 5W by climbing down the tree, once you’ve made it grow. 

From 6W, you can walk off-screen to the west and enter 6L, The Phenocryst Phace. 

You can enter this scene from 5E just by walking onto the 6E balcony. 

From 6E, you can walk up to return to 5E. 

From 6E, you can use the horizontal scroll button to see picture 6R, but you can’t physically walk there. 

If you are on 6E and click the dragon poo on the tree on 6W, we see you reach in your pack, pull out the big wad of dragon crap and throw it across the canyon onto the tree. Direct hit! The tree immediately begins to shake and vibrate as if it has suddenly come alive. It begins to grow, and grow, and grow, until it stretches clear up and out of the picture. Now when you return to 5W, you’ll be able to click on the upper 

branches of that tree and climb down it to your final face puzzle. 

If you are on 6E and click the fan on yourself or the balcony below the cliff you’re on, we see you pull out the feathered fan from your pack, hold it down the cliff and carefully fan air into the Mineral Baths. If the stench-drenched carpet is not on the balcony be- low you, nothing much happens. 

But if the stench-drenched carpet is on the bal- cony  below  you  (outside  the  Mineral  Baths)  we automatically scroll the picture over so we can see all the Baths while keeping you in the upper-left corner of the picture. The smell enters the Baths forcing the women to leap up and run from the Baths through the door  at  the  back  of  the  room.  Now  the  baths  are empty. A tile is in full view for the taking. The carpet remains on the balcony below, but the aroma anima- tion disappears when you return to 5E. 

From  6E,  you  can  use  Boogle  as  a  yo-yo  and lower  him  to  the  balcony  below.  If  the  Baths  are cleared out, you drop him onto the balcony and he walks into the Baths. If the women are inside, one of them comes out here and swats at Boogle. You pull him back up, just in the nick of time.

This cave opens off 6W. The back wall consists of nine identical square empty openings (see Figure 1, The Empty Phenophace below). You apply the nine square tiles you have found lying about throughout this level to the nine openings until you get them all in the correct place and in the correct orientation. 

You can place any tile in any of the 11 opening. If you place it in one of the center nine openings, it remains there until you click it again to pick it up. If it’s in the correct spot, you are unable to pick it up. 

If you click a tile in any corner, upon mouseUp it rotates 90º right or left, depending upon which corner you clicked, and then remains there until you pick it up.

The phenocryst column is a forest green color, indicating  the  land  where  it  concludes.  Since  you have the eressdy powder, you have a free ticket to ride the Phenocryst column. 

All you can do in here is assume the position, throw up (the powder, that is), and whisk away to joy land. Have fun.

pûr¹ge-la is darker, dimly lit by crystals wrapped by plants, plus some light filtering through the dense jungle canopy. It is very damp, with water dripping, flowing, running, splashing, from dripping cliffs to babbling rivulets to tall waterfalls, water is everywhere, making these scenes’ background animation much more interesting. 

The opening scene provides a view of the sky…far away, above the clouds we can see the shell of the world above us, with crystals from the surface poking through like columns lit within. 

The planet is thick with plant life, jungle-like growth, with ferns, creepers, climbers, vines, lianas, convolvulus, bindweed, fern, bracken, and mosses everywhere: club moss, peat moss, sphagnum moss, sterling moss. 

The people are Lilliputian-like, only about 8” tall, Lode Runner size. They have a South American native tribesman look, but they do wear loin cloths. They live in tiny homes nestled inside the roots of the giant trees, far too small for Torin to enter.

coming  very  close  to  yours.  Both  of you consider, linger  just  a  moment  too  long,  then  just  as  a  kiss seems inevitable, Boogle pops out of the pouch and in between your lips. Dozens of cute little laughs ensue. You  both  look  at  Boogle,  then  at  the  Pergolans chuckling around you, and you both laugh too. 

With all the hormones raging through your loin- cloth, it’s no wonder you forget to return her knife. 

Leenah notices you are wounded from your fall, cuts and scrapes mainly, but she insists upon cleaning you up, tenderly applying mud and leaf compresses she  makes  at  the  nearby  stream.  This  gives  us  a chance for conversation, and a little character devel- opment. Boogle watches carefully, learning to be a nurse in the process. Add the nurse icon to Boogle- tory. 

You flirt with Leenah here and there, but during this game, it’s merely puppy-love, nothing more. (The nude swimming virginity-loss scene is probably out.) 

You must continue downward. Hearing you talk of your parents makes Leenah homesick. She decides to  return  home  to  her  family.  You  tell  her  about phenocryst columns and erresdy powder. 

Smetana takes you both to a primitive, religious area, a miniature Stonehenge. We switch to a C. U. Ten little people stand around, five men, five women. Each wears a long robe with a hood, each similar to the others, yet unique. 

The ten little people are arranged in five rows of four  each  to  form  a  five-pointed  star  configuration that nearly fills this first-person screen. Four are alike in one way, but different in four other ways. (In other words:  every  one  has  five  characteristics,  each  of which matches three others. Therefore, four are A, the other six are not A. four are B, the other six are not B, etc.) 

When you click on the first person in this scene, he  takes  a  step  forward  and  waits  until  you  click again. If your second click is on the hot spot at the center of the star formation, he walks there and waits. If  you  click  on  another  person  instead,  the  two  of them trade places.  

This continues until you arrange all ten so each of the five rows is consistent. When you do, the star fills with energy and focuses its power on the ceiling of the area. Bright searchlights aimed straight up il- luminate, one at each point of the star. The five-sided bounded area including the entire star then rises from the floor, carrying Torin, Leenah, Boogle, and the 10 up into the tree’s interior. When it has reached the top 

of the 3-screen vertical scroller, it becomes the next phenocryst  transport  area,  with  two  doors  covering two phenocrysts. 

Then you must rearrange the ten Ostiaries so five women are before the left door and five men are be- fore  the  right  door.  Then  you  can  rearrange  the women  into  an  ascending  fully-diminished  seventh chord arpeggio and rearrange the five men into a de- scending  fully-diminished  seventh  chord  arpeggio. The two phenocryst doors rise up and out of sight, revealing their respective phenocryst columns. Stand with Leenah in the center of the area and say your final good-byes. Toss the powder, boy, we’re outta here! 

 

This  pic is double-wide, double-tall. We begin with it scaled out so we can see all of it at once. We then slowly zoom into the lower-left corner, an area near the phenocryst. Peaceful ambient sounds play. 

After the zoom-scroll is done, Torin reforms out of  the  phenocryst  onto  the  grassy  knoll.  Beautiful, although unusually colored, meadows cover graceful rounded hills stretching to the horizon, with crystals coming through off into the very far distance. Off- color clouds float in a turquoise sky. Regardless of which way you walk, you can take no more than ten steps before you disappear down into the grass. 

- '  

You fall through the tree-tops quickly, although we  take  our  time  to  multi-plane  our  way  down through this four-screen vertical-scroller to find you. We  now  realize  the  vast  expanse  of  hilltops  was really just the top of a jungle canopy.  

Everything is green and lush. The trees are gigan- tic. Panning through the treetops, we see parrots, col- orful  birds,  snakes,  monkeys  and  that  two-headed buzzard from Escarpa. 

We  finally  hear  Torin  land  on  something  soft enough  to  break  his  fall  and  we  continue scrolling down to…

…find a dazed Torin being tied up by tiny Pergo- lans. We’re now on the jungle floor, under the giant trees’ canopy. In long shots, the wee little Pergolans look identical: they dress uniformly and are all 16- pixels tall. In other words, an easy-to-animate multi- tude. 

If you do nothing, you die in a humorous way. EndGame. 

But if you click on the threads soon enough, you break free and stand up, towering above them. One little fellow is trapped on your shoulder as you rise. He hangs onto your collar, screaming to the crowds below. You grab him, the crowd is horrified — they assume you’re going to eat him. You carefully assure him of his safety and gently set him down on a nearby tree root. The crowd roars its approval. 

Smetana steps forward. He’s wearing a slightly different costume, obviously denoting superior rank. We cut to…

You talk a little before Smetana finally asks you to help his people “slay the other giant!” He tells you to follow him, then literally leads you under program control,  past  the  Pergolan  Place  scene  below  to  a third scrolling screen on the right. See below, “Lee- nah in Bondage.”

“The other giant” is Leenah, captured upon her arrival  in  Pergola.  Unlike  you,  she  was  unable  to break free. She’s beautiful, but cautious, defensive, scared.  

Leenah lies on the ground, securely tied up with hundreds of threads, provocatively enough for Dads to enjoy, but not enough that Moms will be offended.  

She assumes since you’re with the Pergolans, you too are the enemy. She screams and struggles unsuc- cessfully to free herself. Her screams drive the Pergo- lans into hiding. They scatter behind plants and roots, then peer over branches and roots to watch this scene. 

If you talk to her before freeing her, she wants to be freed. She doesn’t tell you she has a knife in her scabbard. 

If you show her the locket from her mother be- fore opening it, she doesn’t recognize it. It’s just a locket to her. 

But, if you’ve opened the locket in Inventory, she can now see the pictures of her Mom and Dad, so she realizes you must who you say you are, and you can probably be trusted. Only then will she tell you about the knife she has hidden in her left boot. Now her boot is a hot spot. Click it, and we see you gingerly remove the knife from its “scabbard.” 

If you leave this scene before freeing her, there’s nothing else to do elsewhere. 

When you click the knife on her, we enter …

  First you slice all the tiny threads holding Leenah down. When you do, the Pergolans (who had been hiding  everywhere  around  you)  then  scatter  every which way. You help Leenah sit up, and we cut to a medium two-shot. 

  *BLT Two-Shot* 

  She looks up at you with a “my hero” smile. You hold out the necklace over her head. She misunder- stands your intentions. She thinks you want her to rise up  into  the  necklace.  You  think  she  wants  you  to place it over her head. You both act together. As you bend  down,  she  rises  up.  The  result  is:  your  faces come very close together. She looks down, demurely. The music swells. Both of you pause, linger just a 

  moment  too  long,  considering,  then  just  as  a  kiss seems inevitable, Boogle pops out of your pouch and in between your lips for the first time this world.  

  *Little People Reaction shot* 

  Cut to a shot of lots of little people laughing. Cut back to the two-, now three-, shot.  

  *BLT Two-Shot* 

  You both look at Boogle, then at the Pergolans chuckling around you, and you both laugh too. 

  With all the hormones raging through your loin- cloth, it’s no wonder you forget to return her knife. But we remove the locket from Inventory. 

  *BLT Medium Two-Shot* 

  Cut to a shot showing both of you from the waist up. Boogle hops out of the picture, but does not re- turn  to  the  pouch.  As  your  smiles  fade,  Leenah glances down, noticing the wounds on your arms. The love  theme  swells.  She  silently  indicates  concern, then motions to you to follow her. We let you both rise  up  and  out  of  the  frame,  then  slow  dissolve (sometimes called a cross-fade by some in the indus- try) to… 

  *A Creek Runs Through It* 

  The love theme swells to full volume as we dis- solve in on this scene. We begin with a long shot of the falls off in the distance, dribbling down beautiful fern-covered cliffs. The camera pulls back to reveal the  two  of you sitting beside a stream in the fore- ground, then pans and zooms in until ego is normal size.  Leenah  tenderly  applies  mud  and  leaf  com- presses to your wounds, then washes you with water from the stream. Boogle watches intently from across the screen, learning to be a nurse in the process. Add the nurse icon to Boogletory. 

  As the music ends, we come in on your conversa- tion. Hearing you talk of your parents has made Lee- nah even more homesick. She wants to return home to her  family.  You  tell  her  about  phenocryst  columns and erresdy powder. 

  Smetana reappears to inform you Pergola has a phenocryst chamber too. He leads the two of you off- screen as we fade to black. 

    .  &

  We  fade  in  from  black  to  see  you,  Boogle, Smetana, and Leenah walk into a primitive religious area.  Ten  little  Ostiaries  stand  around.  They  wear long robes with hoods, all similar but each unique. We switch to the Pentagram Puzzle, C. U. below. 

![](Aspose.Words.3c8b9e90-efbf-4934-add4-3f6afb12f5eb.031.png)

Figure 3, Pentagram Priests 

   99.  1

Ten little ostiaries (five men, five women) are ar- ranged  in  five  rows  of  four  each  to  form  a  five- pointed star configuration that nearly fills this first- person screen. See Figure 3, Pentagram Priests above. Four are alike in each of five ways, but different in four other ways. (In other words: every one has five characteristics, each of which matches three others. Therefore, four are A, the other six are not A. four are B,  the  other  six  are  not  B.  Thus,  if  four  have  red hoods, the other six have gray hoods. If four have gold sashes, six more have gray sashes. Sex is not one of the factors.) 

Smetana tells you to get started. You don’t know it, but your goal is to align the Ostiaries in a logical pattern so that each of the five rows is consistent.. The rules are: click on a person, then click where you want him to go. If you click on an empty location, he goes there. If there’s someone there, the two of them trade places. There are 11 locations: the ten shown in the diagram above, plus the center of the star. 

You continue until all ten Ostiaries are correctly aligned. When they are, we cut back to the L. S. to see the pentagon surrounding the pentagram suddenly fill with energy. It begins to glow, light beams burst from the floor to form five vertical shafts of light. The Ostiaries,  you  and  Leenah  all  automatically  move onto  the  pentagon.  The  pentagon  becomes  a  giant stone  elevator  and  rises  up  the  light  beams.  As  it does, we follow it up by scrolling the picture. It stops before two large doors at the… 

-  3

This is the Pergolan phenocryst transport cham- ber. The two far walls form the only real walls here. The floor is in the shape of a pentagon, but the other three sides are the edges of the elevated stone plat- form you’re riding. The back walls are really large stone doors. They hide the phenocrysts we’ve been looking for. 

Both doors open by ascending up and out of the frame and out of sight. (Into the ceiling?) The left door has five arcs with five notes in an ascending line ending on the second arc from the outside. The right door has five arcs with five notes in a descending line ending on the second arc from the inside. The first four notes are solid color, while the fifth (the note representing the destination world) is hollow, like a whole note. These symbols indicate their destination. 

We use the scene change from the scroller to this C. U. to move the ten Ostiaries into two lines of five, all  looking  at  you,  obviously  awaiting  your  further instructions. 

First, sort them out into two groups: male and female. The interface is simple: click on an Ostiary and it takes one step forward. Click on a second and the two trade locations. (This puzzle has no “elev- enth”  spot.)  Click  on  a  third  and  it  steps  forward. Click on the fourth and they swap places. Any time a woman  stands  beside  a  woman  in  front  of  the  left door, they join hands. Any time a man stands beside a man in front of the right door, they join hands. This continues with no further clues until you get all five women in front of the left door and all five men in front of the right door. Then you get some points.  

The Ostiaries then start warming up, each simul- taneously singing his one pitch for a short time, start- ing at random times. This continues until you click on any one of them. This causes all of them to stop and face you again, obviously waiting further instructions. 

Now the women are in random order in front of the left door and the men are in random order in front of the right door. You must rearrange the five women into an ascending arpeggio and the five men into a descending arpeggio.  

Click an Ostiary and he will sing his pitch. The problem is: while he’s singing, the two Ostiaries as- signed  the  pitches  above  him  swap  places.  When they’re in their new positions, the singer stops. For example, if you click on Ostiary 1, 2 and 3 swap loca- tions. If you click on Ostiary 4, 5 and 1 trade places, etc. 

You may click the same Ostiary again to reverse its  effect  (i.e., the two Ostiaries who traded places will return to their original locations). 

Each Ostiary produces a different randomly as- signed note in a fully-diminished-seventh chord. For example, let’s assume the female Ostiaries are ran- domly scattered like this: 

15423 

To solve the puzzle, you would click on each under- lined number, like this: 

15324 

14325 13425 12435 12345 

When you arrange the female Ostiaries into an ascending chord, the left door raises out of sight, re- vealing its sandstone colored crystal (like the cliffs of Escarpa). (Get it? Ascending chord = up one world.)  

When you arrange the male Ostiaries into a de- scending chord like this: 

54321 

the right door raises up and out of sight, revealing its dark orange-red crystal (like the lava of Asthenia). 

You may solve the descending scale puzzle first, causing the right door to lower, but can’t leave until both doors are gone and the phenocryst columns are revealed. 

Then  you  both  walk  to  the  focal  point  of  the phenocrysts at the center of the room and Leenah will automatically follow. You say good-bye, then click the erresdy powder on the two of you. You simulta- neously poof away.

Map of Region 4, Asthenia 

às-thê´nê-e is the land of molten rock, filled with rivers of flowing lava, kind of a magma a la carta. Everything is colored in shades of reds, browns, oranges. This is lava land, with lava tubes for transportation, lava-filled wall sections for light (lava lamps?). Often the only light source in a picture are the lava streams themselves. Fumes spurt from holes in the ground. Paint pots, geysers, volcanism of all kinds. (Picture Yellowstone Park.)  

There are no people evident, anywhere on this planet. However, you do find occasional evidence of earlier life.

Spit out the spit. Stand up. Walk through the spit maze to the wrench, grab it, then walk to the water cannon. Click on the water cannon. In the close-up, click the wrench on the water valve. The cannon’s gauges indicate it’s working. Return to the wide shot. Click on the water cannon to make Torin shoot water across the lava forming a land bridge. Click on the bridge to walk across. It breaks up, just after you pass over. 

Walk on through the next scroller until you come to dozens of stepping stones leading across the lava to the other side. A large bridge rests in the upright, and uncrossable, position. 

Jump from stone to stone, being sure to touch each and every stone before landing on the far shore. As you touch stones, the bridge lowers a little at a time, until when the final stone is touched, the bridge allows  you  to  cross.  Enter  the  building  behind  the bridge. 

In the phenocryst chamber, click on the console. Rearrange the seven shards so the beam of light enter- ing from the left side hits the light sensor on the right side. When it does, the door covering the phenocryst opens. Stand in position, toss your powder, and kiss your Asthenia good-bye!

For  a  pleasant  change,  you  reform  inside  this phenocryst chamber and…nothing bad happens! Ex- cept: there’s no way out. But there is a console in the

room. Unfortunately, the console top is so dirty you can’t see anything. 

Click on the door in the side of the console. If the door is open, you can get the jar of ammonia wipes.  

You can use the ammonia to clean the console top, revealing several buttons. Press the only working button and a door hidden behind the far stone wall opens. You may then walk out the door to find…

This phenocryst column building is on a tiny is- land  of  land  isolated  from  the  mainland  and  com- pletely surrounded by flowing lava. A skinny spit of land in the middle of the lava river leads off-screen to the right and is obviously the only way out. Somehow you must get to that spit of land. 

A small caretaker’s house is attached, but it is locked  and  abandoned.  In  its  backyard  is  a  teeter- totter. Get some stone cannonballs (see next scene) and click them on the teeter-totter. Every time you click your balls on the teeter-totter, you add another ball to the pile on left end. Torin can carry a maxi- mum of five balls. Click the do cursor on the pile of balls and you remove one ball and add it to the num- ber you have in Inventory.  

Click on the empty end of the teeter-totter and you sit down on it. The teeter-totter then adjusts to an angle  commensurate  with  the  number  of  balls  in place. That angle indicates whether you have the cor- rect  number  of  balls  to  balance  your  own  weight. There are only 3 resting positions for the teeter-totter: balls up, balls down, and balanced. 

Your weight on the teeter-totter and in the cata- pult is affected by the number of balls you have in Inventory. 

The teeter-totter has conveniently hinged seats so the ball cells and the cell of you sitting there don’t have to be drawn at hundreds of varied angles. 

If  you’re  sitting  on  the  teeter-totter  and  click anywhere else, you get off and walk to that. You can’t add or subtract balls to the teeter-totter while riding it.

This machine looks like an illicit cross-breed be- tween a miniature golf park and a gumball machine It dispenses bowling ball-sized stone cannonballs, con- sistent in size and weight, for use as ammunition in the slingshot catapult. 

To get a cannonball, Torin presses the button on the machine, a ball comes out down a strange path, ‘round and ‘round and ‘round she goes, ‘til she finally shoots off the end of the ramp, right at Torin. If you are not in position, the ball flies off screen. If you are, you  catch  the  ball  and  it  gets  added  to  Inventory. Torin can carry a maximum of five balls. 

&  

On the opposite side of the phenocryst chamber from  the  caretaker’s  house  is  its defense system: a catapult. 

The  catapult  hurls  whatever  is  in  its  bucket across the lava stream. It is made of heavy timbers, its thrust created by bending a long wooden beam via a thick rope and winch. The rope connects the bucket end of the beam with a large drum geared with a still- larger crank. A trigger releases the ratchet, allowing the rope to unroll, which lets the arm hurl whatever is in its bucket.  

If you click the crank, we see you cock the giant arm all the way. 

The  release  is  only  hot  while  the  bucket  is 

cocked. 

You  can  click  the  cannonball(s)  icon  on  the cocked bucket.  

Want to get rid of cannonballs you’re carrying? Click a ball on the lava river, we see you shot put the ball into the lava, where it makes a reassuring splash. 

RULES: you weigh 4 balls, the catapult can hurl 5 balls to safety, you can carry 5 balls, you can get as many from the dispenser as you can carry, you can only  drop  a  ball  on  the  teeter-totter,  the  catapult’s cocked bucket, or in the lava. 

Once you know how many stone balls equal your weight,  you can put that many balls in the bucket, crank the winch and see where the balls land in the lava. Usually the cannonballs will splash to a fiery death, but when you load the catapult with five balls, they’ll land on the tiny spit of land. 

When you are ready, you cock the bucket, climb in, cut the rope with your knife to hurl yourself across the  lava  to  a  spit-safe  landing  in  the  Spittin’  Spit C. U. below. 

You must launch yourself while carrying one ex- tra cannonball in your Inventory, or you’ll fly over the  top  of  the  spit.  If  you  carry  extra cannonballs, you’ll undershoot the spit. Both of these provide with a wonderful, though quick, death. EndGame.

A C. U. of Torin lying face down in the sand. He raises his head, spits out sand, then Boogle flies in, landing right on his head, forcing him back into the mud puddle. Torin pulls his head out, mud dripping off  his  face,  Boogle  takes  a  good  laugh.  While Boogle laughs we see the shadow of a ball growing over Boogle until it lands on his head, squishes him flat  as  a  pancake.  Torin  pulls  Boogle  up  off  the ground, shakes him out to normal volume and returns him to the pouch. We change to…

You  walk  along  a  maze-like  (which  is  almost nothing like a real maze!) group of land spits on a three-screen wide scroller. You are surrounded on all sides by flowing lava.  

There’s a glint from one part of the screen that contains the wrench. Walk there and get the wrench. 

Walk to the dead end wall with the fire hose wa- ter cannon mounted on it and we change to…

In  this  close-up  of  the  water  cannon,  we  see gauges and meters that move when Torin turns it on. He does this by reading Roust and giving champagne and caviar. No! Easier than that, he does it by click- ing the wrench on the valve. The gauges activate, the vials fill with water, pressure builds. But we don’t see his hand enter the pic. 

We immediately change to…

This is a first person view of the river with the cannon at the bottom of the screen. Click on the can- non to start it spraying. As you spray the near side, the  lava  hardens.  Then,  if  you  spray  the  next  area across the river, it hardens.  Keep spraying back and forth and eventually the entire river is spanned by a stretch of hardened lava.  

When the bridge is done, you and Boogle then cross it quickly because as you soon as you cross any piece,  it  dissolves  just  behind  you!  This  takes  you onward to the next screen… 

natural stone bridges and complicated pathways. The main river runs through here as well, but is fed my many colorful waterfalls of lava. Multi-colored paint pots bubble and drip.  

As Torin enters this scene, Indiana Jones swings under a bridge supported only by his whip and falls into the lava. Tripe & Viscera, the two-headed buz- zard from Escarpa, is still following that leg o’ meat. They  notice  him,  but  decide  to  continue  following their piece of meat “because he’s way over done.”  

A  three-screen-wide  scroller  takes  you  in,  out, and through many seemingly random (but not) tun- nels and bridges. You eventually wind up at… 

#

Here  the  river  of  flowing  lava  has  no  floating rock  pieces,  but  instead  is  filled  with  a  pattern  of stone pilings in the shape shown in Figure 4, Steps Across  the Lava below. They are clearly “stepping stones,” which require you to jump to reach them.  

At the far side of the river is the entrance to the phenocryst  temple,  with  a  drawbridge  beside  the door. Every time you step on a new stone, the bridge lowers a little closer to the ground. You must touch all the stones for the door to open and you must be on the other side in order to go through the door. 

You begin on the near side, at the word “start” 

below.  

As  soon  as  you  touch  any  stone,  that  stone’s timer starts running. About 3 seconds after you land on it, it begins to glow. After it glows for about 3 seconds, it starts to sink. If you’re still on it, you turn, face the camera and ride it down, ending in a Arnold T-2 pose and your death. EndGame. 

As long as you are off a stone before it starts down,  you  get  to  keep  going.  Stones  beyond  your maximum jump length don’t get hot spots, so you are unable to attempt a jump you can’t complete. 

There are “reset” levers on both sides of the lava. Pull one, and all the stones return to their fully up- right and locked position.

This  scene  is  a  lot  like  the  other  phenocryst chambers, with a console in one corner and a podium 

directly  in  front  of  the  big  crystal.  There  are  six shards arranged in a hexagon, plus another in the cen- ter of the hexagon. Each reflects light, either at a 45º, 90º, or 135º angle. A beam of colored light enters the left-most shard from its left. Since a 90º right crystal always starts off in hole #1, the light exits off the bot- tom of the screen and the other crystals are all dark. 

Place the remaining six crystals in the six remain- ing holes in random order, determined upon entering the C. U. Shard 1 is always a 90ºR. The others are: 90ºL, 90ºR, 135ºL, 45ºL, 135ºR, 45ºL. See Figure 5, Console Shards & Angles, below.  

The phenocryst column is very dark gray, indi- cating Tenebrous, where it concludes. 

Assume the position, throw up the powder, and whisk away to Tenebrous.

Map of Region 5, Tenebrous 

tèn´e-bres is the dark zone surrounding the very center of the planet, with little natural light, and a dramatic Blade Runner look and feel, made of smooth, almost metallic, stone that’s shiny damp with moisture, with strong horizontal directional light casting deep shadows everywhere. The sky here is very near the surface. Water drips eve- rywhere. The people live in high-rise stalactites. 

Everything is dark and gloomy…except the people. They are near albinos, tall, thin, with large heads and skinny fingers, rather weak, with wispy thin blondish-white hair, or even no hair at all. They’re also hilarious, full of one- liners and puns. Everyone has a smart-ass answer to everything, which is their way of over-compensating for their cimmerian environment. 

Your goal here is to get arrested and thrown out of their world into the Null Void, the absolute center of the planet Strata, where there is no gravity whatsoever. Cross the Void and on the other side you’ll find at last, the en- trance to Lycentia’s Lair.

We see the phenocryst column but no ego. There is  a  huge  explosion  as  your  body  reforms—in  the same space as a large pipe! You drop to the floor, unconscious. 

Switch  to  Boogletory,  select  the  Boogle-nurse icon and click it on Torin to see Boogle humorously administer  first  aid.  Instead  of  mouth-to-mouth,  he reaches through the interface, presses the Inventory 

button, selects the ammonia you picked up in Asthe- nia, and administers it to you. You awaken, none the worse for wear. 

If you climb the stack of boxes and crates in the corner, you find a heat vent in the upper-left corner of the screen. Use Leenah’s knife to remove the grill on the heat vent. Crawl inside to safety. 

Now there’s not much to do but crawl through the next three screens. As you near the far left edge of the third screen, you “bump your head” on the menu bar. Boogle fixes it for you, and you continue crawl- ing. As soon as you enter the next scene, you take the world’s  longest  fall  through  darkness.  As  you  fall, you see the leg-O’-meat and the buzzard go by. You scream, “Boogle! Save us!!” 

Fortunately, you “achieve a soft landing”—in a flower bed near a phenocryst column, one of the few gardens in this otherwise dark world! Unfortunately, Boogle  misunderstood  your  “save  us”  as  “safe us,” and so has transformed himself into a safe. He lands on your head, not hurting you, of course, since he’s still  only  Boogle  weight.  You  reach  up,  open  his “safe-door” to reveal your face, and say, “Save us. I said, ‘Save us!’” Upon which, Boogle turns red, then back to a Boogle. 

A nearby beat cop arrests for “cruelty to plants!” and hauls you off to jail. You are placed in a holding cell, pending your arraignment before the magistrate. Your knife is removed from Inventory and Boogle is not allowed to go in with you. Out your jail cell win- dow, you helplessly watch as Dreep captures Boogle and carries him back to Lycentia’s Lair. 

You appear before the judge and tell him of your fall from the phenocryst. He’s sure that’s impossible, as no one has used any phenocryst column for years. He warns you not to get arrested again, (“two strikes and you’re out!”) then orders the cop to return you to where he found you. He does and leaves you standing there, this time well outside the planter. 

Mrs.  Plant  strikes  up  a  conversation  with  you. She tells you about R. Kyvest and the amphitheater. 

She  complains  about  how  “those  chameleon  silk- worms  are  killing  me  and  my  friends  here.  If  you would help us, my friends will help you ascend the Slippery Slope.” 

So you look at the plants by her “roots” and we see a C. U. of the leaves. If you try to pluck a silk- worm from a half-eaten leaf, it quickly scoots around to the backside of the leaf and stays there until you move the cursor. Back in the long shot there is a hot spot that reveals a C. U. of some “dawburr” plants. In the C. U., you take a dawburr, walk to the tree grow- ing beside the Slippery Slope, talk to the “sentimental tree” until you make it “cry sap,” then collect the sap that oozes from the tree with your dawburr, return to the silkworm C. U. and paint any silkworm’s leaf with the sap. When it returns to the front of the leaf, the sticky sap slows it so much you are able to grab them before they can get to the back of the leaf. You only need to paint one. We’ll do the others for you. Add four chameleon silkworms to Inventory. 

Return  to  the  Slippery  Slope.  Now  when  you slowly move your cursor around over the grass you can hear the grass squeak “yea” or “nay.” When you hear “yea,” click the mouse without moving the cur- sor and you’ll walk safely to that spot. 

Eventually you’ll reach the top, where you see Tenebrous spread out before you. A large Hollywood Bowl-shaped amphitheater lies between you and the rest of the towns reminding you of the game’s Table of  Contents  screen.  The  only  available  path  leads backstage. You walk to the stage door and enter. 

Backstage you find an old set of bagpipes from high atop some storage shelves. Behind the magician is a colorful poster advertising another magician, but it’s hanging upside down. You can take them both. 

Soon after you arrive, the tap-dancing centipede walks past, tossing his top hat and cane onto a table before exiting out the stage door. Once he’s gone, you can take them both anytime. 

When you see the rabbit quit the archery act be- cause he was nearly hit by the drunken archer again, the archer throws his bow against the back wall in disgust, grabs his jug and walks off-screen, never to be seen again. Once he’s gone, you can take it any- time. 

If you talk to the blind magician practicing back- stage, he shows you a card trick. After it fails, he be- moans how he “needs a better act.” After watching it, you agree. 

After you’ve talked to the magician, you can talk to  the  rabbit,  suggesting  a  new  partner.  The rabbit agrees to work with the magician, if you can assure him of better working conditions. After that, if you click the top hat on him, we watch you set down the top  hat so the rabbit can climb inside. Congratula- tions. You now have a top hat with a rabbit inside. You can Give it to the Magician, but it’s not enough. 

Combine  the  silkworms  and  the  magician’s poster in Inventory and the worms will create a beau- tiful paisley silk kerchief. You can give it to the Ma- gician, but it’s only enough if you’ve given him all the other items too. 

Manipulate the cane in Inventory to break it into a wand, plus a bunch of splinters, which you discard. You can give it to the Magician, but it’s only enough if you’ve given him all the other items too. 

You can’t combine all the magic trick ingredients in Inventory. But after you give the entire collection to the blind magician, he’s so appreciative, he gives you his “Book of Magic Spells, Volume 7.” (“I cain’t read it anyways!”) He says it should be enough to get you past any tough sorcerers you may find “in these parts!” The assistant director summons him on-stage to friendly reviews. 

At any time backstage, you can talk to the archi- vist, an old man with an crystcorder set up in a corner to record tonight’s talent. Talk to him; trade him your voice for a shard with a recording of Lycentia’s voice “so you’ll know what she sounds like when you see her!” 

Once you have the bow and the Book of Magic Spells, the assistant director summons the acrobat on stage  to  perform.  She  leaves  her rosin. Once she’s gone, you can take it anytime.  

If you talk to the assistant director, he asks about your talent and says “we need musicians, but no more bagpipers! Come up with something different! I don’t care if it’s a musical saw, just get ready. You’re on soon!” 

The whole time you were here, a carpenter has been building a set, sawing boards, then nailing them together.  Once  you  have  Lycentia’s  shard  and  the bagpipes, and have talked thoroughly to the carpen- ter, he’s done. Now when you return to his location, you find him gone, his set gone, but his crosscut saw is still leaning against the wall. Once he’s gone, you can take it anytime. 

If you combine the archer’s bow and the saw in Inventory,  you  get  a  few  scratchy,  bad-sounding notes, with a clue about “your bow needs rosin.” 

Combine the bow and the rosin in Inventory to create a better-sounding bow. Now if you combine the rosined bow and the saw in Inventory, you get a few lovely notes, with a clue about waiting your turn to go on. 

When you finally have the Book, the shard, the saw, and the rosined bow, the assistant director sum- mons you to the stage to give your performance. Now you can walk behind the curtains. We see you from upstage  as  you  cross  and  sit  on  a  stool  facing  the empty house. If you click the saw on yourself, you announce  “a  medley  of  selections  from  The  Lands Above,” and you play until the show’s director has you arrested again. Why? For impersonating a musi- cian! (“Officer! You have tears in your eyes. Are you from The Lands Above too?” “No, I’m a musician!”) 

The cop hauls you off to the same judge again, but without a stop in the jail cell this time. The judge is not very understanding! He sentences you to im- mediate ostracization: “Into the Null Void with him!” he cries. 

We cut to a scene showing the heavily locked vault door leading to the Null Void. The cop roughs you up a little this time, slamming you against the wall beside the door. We hear the sound of breaking glass as Lycentia’s audcryst is shattered. Then, it’s into the Null Void you go. 

Fortunately, you have the bagpipes to maneuver through the asteroids. As you float, you see the leg- O’-meat and the vulture one last time. 

Use  the  crystcorder  to  place  the  pieces  of  the broken shard back together in random ways to pro- duce original voice snippets using actual audio sam- ples. You want something like, “Mr. Watson, come here. I need you.” 

But to confuse Dreep, you must arrange the cor- rect shard pattern in the shard player: “Dreep. Come here.  I  need  you!”  Then  you  start  the  crystcorder playing, place it on an asteroid out in the Void, then ring Lycentia’s doorbell and, during the short pause before Dreep opens the door, walk around the porch to  the  bottom  side  (upside  down)  spaceship-style. Dreep opens the door, hears Lycentia’s voice, is ob- viously  confused,  but  floats  off  towards  Lycentia’s voice,  never  to  bother  you  again.  You  then  slip around to the top of the porch and enter Lycentia’s Lair and you’re off to Chapter 6.

This  old  phenocryst  column  transportation chamber has been unused for years, so it’s now serv- ing as a locked storeroom to some unmentioned busi- ness.  As  you  appear  from  the  dusty  phenocryst column,  you  reform  partially  inside  a  water  pipe, causing it to explode and you to be rendered uncon- scious.  Boogle  jumps  from  your  pouch  and  stands there, looking worried. 

No Inventory objects are active. No cursors are live except the Nurse icon in Boogletory. 

Your  only  course of action is to switch to the Boogletory,  select  the  Nurse  icon,  and  click  it  on Torin. Boogle then slaps your face, gives you CPR, and starts to give you mouth-to-mouth but does a “no way” take to the camera. He looks around in fear, then  “breaks  the  fourth  wall”  by  reaching  way  out over the interface, pressing the Inventory button, and selecting  the  ammonia  from  Inventory.  He  does  a take, winks at the player, then holds it under ego’s nose, finally tosses the ammonia away. At last Torin revives! 

If you use Leenah’s Knife on the heat duct’s grill in  the  upper-left  corner,  we  see  you  climb  up  the boxes  until  you  are  near  the  ceiling  (if  you’re  not there already), pry the vent open, and crawl inside. Boogle goes in after you. And we change to… 

-   

On this screen, your position is at first not readily apparent. You are inside a heat duct above a room. The only way for you to maneuver is to use the cur- sor. We occasionally see you through some small air vents as you crawl past on your belly, but you can’t remove those vents—and besides, they’re too small for you to pass through. 

Inside the air duct, as you work your way West, the surrounding interiors grow darker and more fore- boding. As you pass through these “duct” screens, the background music rises in volume and intensity, as if something big is about to happen. 

There’s not much to do here but crawl through the duct. You can’t exit back to the previous room. All you can do is go west. 

-    

Ditto, except you can exit East…but why would you  want  to?  Scary  music  builds  in  intensity  with each room. 

Now the duct in which you are crawling is almost off the top of the screen. As you near the far left edge, you “bump your head” on the menu bar. SoundFX. The scary music stops. We lower a fake File Menu with a loud soundFX. You grunt in pain. After a beat, Boogle pokes his head out the nearest vent, squawks and rolls up the menu bar like a window shade. Flap, flap, flap, etc. You continue crawling west. The music resumes where it was.

As soon as you enter this pic, you crawl out of the open end of the air duct, hang in space for a beat, Boogle’s head pops out of the bag to do a camera “take,” then you both plummet downward. You yell the standard, I’m-falling, “Ahhhh!”, but you eventu- ally run out of air, have to take another breath, then start it again until you have no more low register left. Finally you cry, “Boogle! Save us!!” 

As you fall, we see a dark screen with occasional upward-bound points of light screaming past, the leg- O’-meat and the buzzard, but little other detail, just a bird’s-eye view looking straight down as ego shrinks to a pixel. Go to Planter Violation, below.

First time in scene: 

You land here on your back in a soft bed of land- scaped plants, leaving a Torin-shaped depression in the plants. After a beat, you sit up. Then another fal- ling sound makes you look up just as Boogle enters the screen in the shape of a safe. He lands on your head with a loud clang, but doesn’t hurt you because he’s still only Boogle weight, remember? You reach up, open his safe door to show us your face, then say, “Save  us.  I  said,  ‘Save  us!’”  Upon  which,  Boogle turns  red  with  embarrassment,  then  back  into  a Boogle  wrapped  around  Torin’s  head.  He  unwraps and slithers back into the pouch. 

As Boogle is slithering, a cop enters and arrests you for “cruelty to plants!” Go to Judge Cartoon 1, below. 

Second time in scene: 

We fade in from black after returning from Jail Cartoon 1 to find you standing on the sidewalk beside the flower bed you originally landed in. The cop is gone for good. Now, you can walk South from this scene to the Slippery Slope, but no other direction.

If you talk to Mrs. Plant, we go to the Mrs. Plant 

C. U. below. 

If you look at the low-lying growth here (to see the silkworms), we see you get down on your knees, bend over, then we go to the Silkworm C. U. below. 

If you look at the bushy growth here, we go to the Dawburr C. U. below. 

That’s all there is to do here.

Remove the knife from Inventory. Remove the Boogletory and both its icon and the Inventory icon from the interface. 

You sit in the corner of a solid rock jail cell with no  visible  door.  You  ruminate  a  while,  wondering how  you’re  going  to  escape,  whether  you’ll  reach your parents in time, what’s happening to poor little Boogle. Things are going badly. You rise from your corner,  walk  to  the  barred  window,  and  we  cut  to Torin’s POV. 

Through the bars we see a dejected Boogle sit- ting  outside  the  jail, when Dreep suddenly appears behind him! You shout, but Boogle can’t hear you. Dreep grabs Boogle and carries him away! Now it’s even more important for you to continue on, to rescue not only your parents, but your best buddy. (It also means Torin can encounter Lycentia alone, without Boogle hanging around.) 

We return to third-person in time to hear the cop tell you it’s time to see the judge. 

Cross-dissolve to you standing before a large ju- dicial bench while the judge asks if you have anything to say. You attempt to explain you are only seeking Lycentia.  You  tell  him  of  your  fall  from  the phenocryst. He’s sure that’s impossible, as no one has used phenocryst columns for many years. The judge says he’s kind and sentences you only to probation. “But hear this: we don’t give extra chances here in Tenebrous. Get arrested again and it’s straight to the Null Void with you!” Then to the cop, “Now take him back where you found him!”

She tells you about R. Kyvest and the amphithea- ter. She complains about how “those chameleon silk- worms  are  killing  me  and  my  friends  here.  If  you 

would help us, my friends will help you ascend the Slippery Slope.” 

'  1

These “dawburr” plants have flowers and leaves that remind you of a brush. You may take one. 

&)'   1

If you try to pluck a silkworm from a half-eaten leaf with your hand, it quickly scoots around to the backside of the leaf and stays there until you move the cursor. 

If you use the naked dawburr on the leaves, the same thing happens. No go. 

But, if you use the sap-covered dawburr on a leaf with a worm, we see the silkworm zip behind the leaf as your cursor approaches. You paint the leaf with sap. Then as you move away, the worm returns to the front side of the leaf, the sticky sap slows him down. You need paint only one of the leaves. 

When a worm is on the front side of a sticky leaf and you move the hand over him, he tries to escape but can’t. He disappears and is added to Inventory. We then fade to black to imply time passing while you pick all the worms, then fade up on the Planter Violation L. S. above. 

1 && 

There is a “sentimental tree” growing here beside the Slippery Slope. If you look at it, we see you touch it  and  discover  it’s  oozing  very  sticky  sap  from  a small wound. If you use the dawburr on it, it says there’s not enough sap running out this small opening to cover that large dawburr. 

But if you talk to the tree long enough, its senti- mental nature causes it to cry. “I was transplanted at birth!” Then you can collect the sap oozing from the tree with your dawburr. 

Just past the sappy tree, the slippery grass marks the  end  of  the  path.  If  you  haven’t  taken  the  silk- worms, the cursor is silent but accommodating and you  nearly  always  hit  a  slippery  spot  and  slide screaming  and  flailing  off  the  bottom  of  the  pic. EndGame. 

But  if  you  have  gathered  the  worms,  now  the grass helps you by telling you where the safe spots are. If you slowly move the cursor around over the grass, the grass squeaks, “yea” or “nay.” If you click the mouse where you hear a “yea,” you’ll carefully 

walk to that spot without falling. Eventually you can reach the top of the hill. 

But if you click where you heard a “nay,” you slide off the bottom of the screen just as if you ha- ven’t gathered the worms. EndGame. 

Each click is random within n pixels of your cur- rent location, but generally trending towards the goal at the far right of the pic. 

When you reach that goal, we hear the grass ap- plaud Torin, see him turn to face them, do an elabo- rate stage bow crushing a flower in the process. The applause turns to gasps, Torin looks sheepish, says, “Oops,” and turns to face away. We go immediately to the Tenebrous L. S. below. 

   &

A long, establishing shot of Tenebrous, showing the  Tenebrous  Bowl  in  the  medium  distance,  with several towering stalactite cities behind it, marching off into the far distance. The rock is dark, damp. Wa- ter drips. The angle of light is very low, so long shad- ows  are  cast  across  the  area.  The  curvature  of  the planet is so tight here, we can actually see it in this shot. 

Tenebrous Bowl is immense. It must seat 75,000 people. Its sound shell is a metaphor for the planet, showing  a  cross-section  of  the  five  worlds,  as  if  a quarter of the planet was cut away. 

There’s only one way to go here, forward, off the hill, down to the plain to the Tenebrous M. S. below.

A closer shot of the Bowl to establish the layout, the seats and the stage door. 

There’s only one way to go here, forward to the Tenebrous Bowl stage door below.

You  arrive  at  a  large  door  marked “PERFORMERS ONLY.” Since there’s nowhere else to go, you decide to go in.

Figure 6, Backstage at Tenebrous Bowl 

0) 5

Backstage is all one 5-screen scroller. You enter between screen 2 and 3. Screen 5 is nothing but the back of the stage curtains, hiding the stage. You may enter the stage (once you’re ordered to do so) through either edge of the curtains.  

The  running  joke  backstage  is  everyone  Torin meets asks if he’s the musical saw player. “Too bad. What  this  show  needs  is  another  special  sawist!” “Special sauce?” 

0) 

The  Assistant  Director  sits  here  on  her  stool. When you finally have the Book of Magic Spells, the shard of Lycentia’s voice, the saw, and the rosined bow, the A.D. summons you to the stage to audition. 

Backstage 1 is the far left screen (far stage right). From L-R, you see: the opening to go on-stage; the light panel; the acrobats’ warm-up area; a carpenter working  on  a  set;  and  behind  him,  the  rack  of  fly ropes. 

Once you have the bow and the Book of Magic Spells, the assistant director summons the acrobats to the stage to perform, never to be seen again. They leave their rosin backstage. From now on, you can take the rosin anytime. 

The carpenter works on the set until you have Lycentia’s shard and the bagpipes, and have talked thoroughly to the carpenter. Then when you return to this scene, he’s gone, the set’s gone, but his crosscut saw is lying on the sawhorses. From now on, you can take the saw anytime.

This is to the left of the stage door (stage right). The archery act rehearses here.

Shortly  after  you  arrive,  the  tap-dancing  centi- pede walks past, tossing his top hat and cane onto a table with a comment of disgust and heads out the stage door. You can then take either or both of them. 

A nervous rat practices his archery act with his assistant, a rabbit. The first time ego enters this scene we take control and show the rat take aim and fire his arrow. We cut to follow the arrow’s path in slow mo- tion  from  the  arrow’s  POV  (Kevin  Costner  Robin Hood-style) almost to the rabbit’s face. As the rab- bit’s head gets big, he looks scared. We hear the rab- bit (in deep slo-mo voice), see the rabbit’s ears grab the apple off his head, lower it to “eye” level, as his body deforms to the right. The arrow splits the apple, but only because of the rabbit’s quick reflexes. We return to the L. S. to see the rabbit throw down the apple in disgust and quit the act. The rat yells after him, “You can’t quit! You’re fired!” as he throws the bow at the rabbit, and misses him that way too. He then grabs his whisky jug and walks off-screen. We only see this sequence once. 

Once the cartoon is over, you can take the bow. The rabbit continues to hang out in the same general area backstage, sulking. If you talk to the rabbit, we go to the Rabbit C. U. below. 

0) 

This is to the right of the stage door (stage left). From L-R you see: the backstage door; the bulletin board with a table under it and the magician’s warm- up area. If you click on him, we go to his own C. U., below. 

0)  

This is to the far right (far stage left). From L-R you  see:  some  storage  shelves  with  a  bagpipe;  the archivist’s  workstation;  and  the  opening  to  go  on stage. 

You can take the old set of bagpipes from high atop the storage shelves. 

At any time here, you can talk to the archivist, who is set up in the stage left corner to record to- night’s talent. Go to the Archivist C. U. below. 

0) !

This part of the pic is all curtains. Nothing hap- pens here. Later, maybe we can add comic silhouettes of on-stage acts. 

4  1

Once you’ve talked to the magician, you can talk to the rabbit. He agrees to go to work for the magi- cian,  if  you  can  assure  better  working  conditions. From that point on, if you click the top hat on him, we see you set it down and him climb inside. This creates a hat with a rabbit inside. 

2   1

The blind magician is practicing his act and asks you to help. He gives you the deck of cards, has you pick one and remember it. Clasp the deck tightly and he’ll make the card leave the deck. He then pulls out of his sleeve “your card,” but it’s a bouquet of paper flowers. Second try is a dove, which flies away. Third is the book of magic spells, which he returns to his sleeve. 

If you talk to him after the trick, he knows he’s having  trouble.  “I  could  really  use  a  good  magic trick.” 

He’ll  give  you  a  reasonable  answer  for almost anything you offer. But what he really wants is the top hat with the rabbit inside, covered with the silk kerchief, with the magic wand on top. If you give him this,  he’s  so  appreciative,  he  gives  you  his  “101 Magic Spells, Large Print Edition.” He says it should be enough to get you past any tough sorcerers you may find “in these parts!” 

You  give  him  the  magic  trick  ingredients  (al- most) one at a time (with the rabbit inside the hat being the only exception). He accepts them, but in- sists “that’s not enough for a complete magic trick” until you give him everything.

Trade  him  your  voice  for  a  shard  with  a  re- cording of Lycentia’s voice “so you’ll know what she sounds like when you see her!” 

Two shot of you and the old man, chatting and swapping shards. When you talk to him, you tell him you’re seeking Lycentia and of your quest to rescue your parents. When you mention Lycentia, he reacts visibly. “Why, yes, I know that name. I’m one of the few around here who does. I record rare voices, and hers is one of the rarest!” He tells you “you’re very close. All you have to do is gain access to the Null Void, find your way across it somehow, and you’ll be at her lair.” You ask for the shard of her voice and he balks. “What can you offer?” Fortunately, you have something  even  more  scarce:  “a  voice  from  The 

Lands Above!”—your voice! He agrees, records you and gives you an audcryst containing Lycentia’s voice and a crystcorder to play it on. He tells you the only way to her find her is to make your way across the Null  Void,  but  because  it’s  so  dangerous,  no  one knows the location of the entrance to it. 

Once you’ve dealt with him and have the shard, he remains in this scene until you leave. Then, when- ever you return, he’s gone. 

- & 

This pic is from behind Torin, looking out at the thousands of seats in the amphitheater, with the lights glaring in his face. 

You click the saw on yourself and we see you sit down on a wooden chair, bend the saw between your legs, and rosin up your bow. You announce, “I going to play a medley of songs from The Lands Above,” and then play something with too much vibrato. 

While you’re playing, you see the director mo- tioning to someone off-stage. A few seconds later, the same  familiar  cop  walks  on-stage  and  arrests  you! You  stop  playing  and  say,  “But  officer,  you  have tears in your eyes! Are you from The Lands Above, too?”  He  replies,  “No…I’m  a  musician!”  Pause  a beat, then, “And you’re under arrest—for impersonat- ing a musician!” Go to Judge Cartoon 2, below. 

- &"$ ; , 

This time, we skip the jail sequence and begin with the “before the judge” pic. Since you violated probation, the judge “has no choice” but to sentence you  to  immediate  ostracization  from  the  commu- nity—“Into the Null Void with him!” he cries. This time  we  see  you  smile  ever  so  slightly.  Now  you know that’s exactly where you want to go. 

We cut to a scene showing the heavily locked door  leading  to  the  Null Void. Since it’s your last chance to be together, the cop “accidentally” roughs you up a little, slamming you against the wall beside the door. We hear the sound of breaking glass as Ly- centia’s  audcryst  is shattered. But immediately, it’s into the Null Void you go. 

; , 

A square picture, over one screen wide (perhaps 2 wide X 4 high?), that contains the weightless sphere that is The Null Void. Rocks of various sizes revolve and  float  by  in  multi-plane  glory.  You  must  make your way through the rocks and crystal columns by 

using the bagpipe as an imitation rocket booster, until you locate Lycentia’s porch across the Void. 

The bagpipe reverses our usual interface: instead of  clicking  where  you  want  to  go,  you  must  click where you want to leave. We see you aim the bag- pipes where you clicked, hear the bagpipe crank up its pitiful sound, and see you fly off in the opposite direction until you hit an asteroid or something. Mul- tiplane scroller, faked with views, makes some aster- oids appear to be farther back, others middle, others closer.  The  leg-O’-meat  from  Escarpa  floats  past. Soon after, so does the two-headed buzzard. 

Once you have the broken shard pieces properly arranged in the crystcorder and it is turned on, you may click it on one of the asteroids near Lycentia’s door to leave it there. 

#+  

Lycentia’s place has a cute little front porch and doorbell. Since it’s in the Null Void, there’s no grav- ity, so when you land on it, you’re at an ~163º angle to horizontal. (You’re nearly upside-down.) So every- thing, including you, is at a crazy skew. 

When  you  ring  Lycentia’s  doorbell,  there  is  a short pause before Dreep opens the door. If you are still standing at the door when he does, he grabs you. EndGame. 

If you ring the bell and walk to the bottom of the porch, Dreep just looks confused before going back inside, closing the door after him. But…you get to live. 

But  if  you  click  under  the  porch,  you  walk around the porch to the bottom side (upside down) spaceship-style. There, Dreep can’t see you, so you don’t die. However, he just looks confused and re- turns inside. You can do this over and over again. 

If you have the crystcorder and you put the bro- ken shard pieces into order to say Al G. Bell’s line, “Dreep, come here. I need you.” or anything close to that and you have started it playing and you leave it on an asteroid and you ring the bell and you hide un- der the porch, the rest is nearly automatic! You wait until Dreep’s off-screen, then you sneak around the porch and enter the door, locking it behind you…and we’re off to… 

-  \*: #\*- 

A simple, long corridor, lined with previous vic- tims  of Lycentia’s dirty deeds, each inside a green crystalline  suspended-animation  structure.  Torin 

walks  through  this  scene  to  get  to  the  actual  Lair. Since we’re looking down the hall to the entrance, he scales up dramatically as he walks toward the camera. The nearest few feet holds the Fahrmans and Boogle, 

clearly  visible,  but  sealed  up  and  in  communicato. Torin  walks  through,  looks  at  his  parents  and  pal, then continues walking forward to the Epilogue, Ly- centia’s Lair!

Pecand appears in the vidcryst monitor on the far wall, starts to speak, but decides to listen instead. 

6  Lycentia cries, “Foolish boy. I have more power in my little finger than you’ll 

ever possess!” 

8  To demonstrate, she zaps Torin with a mere toss of her wrist and flick of her 

little finger, but the effect is devastating! Torin is hurled backwards, across the room, slamming into the far wall with a groan. He slides to the floor onto his butt, nearly unconscious, his shirt torn open, exposing the birthmark on his shoulder. Lycentia heads for Torin.

such an angle that neither will be able to see Pecand’s forthcoming entrance.

held them in a magic spell.” 

10  Lycentia, reassuringly: “No, Torin, the Fahrmans are safe. But they’re not 

your real parents. Your real parents were the King and Queen of The Lands Above!” 

8  Torin: “What?” Realization sinks in. “Then… I’m…” 

3  Lycentia: “That’s right. You’re the next king!” 

6  Camera 7 again  Pecand teleports into room, with dagger drawn, on the move as he material- izes: “No, that’s wrong. I’m the next king!” 

5  Pecand stabs Lycentia in the back (where we can’t see it go in). As she stag-

gers back, he pulls out the knife, tossing her into position for her later spell- casting. Pecand heads for Torin. Torin rises to standing position. 

14  Camera 10, X. C. U.  Pecand, bloody knife in hand, with much sarcasm: “You should have died in Pecand’s face  your cradle that night, little nephew! After searching for you all these years, 

you won’t escape me now!” 

He pauses a beat before the punch line: “I killed your parents…and now I’ll kill you!” 

6  Camera 7 again  As Pecand reaches out with the dagger, Torin sidesteps the blade, grabs Pe-

cand’s head, and slams it into the wall. Pecand staggers back, giving Torin 

enough time to do a fancy kick to the chest. Pecand falls backward, almost on 

top of Lycentia. He grabs her by the hair and places the dagger on her throat. 4  Pecand, holding the dagger at Lycentia’s throat: “One step closer, boy, and I’ll 

finish her.”

We see Lycentia awake now. We see in her eyes that she’s about to do some- thing. She winds up for a magic spell. It looks like she’s going to zap Torin. She fires, but it goes right past him (and us). 

We see Pecand is now out of the pit, behind Torin and about to stab him in the back. Lycentia’s spell hits him, turns him into green crystal and sends him flying down her front hallway toward the Null Void. 

Pecand flies out the door, then into the Null Void straight for the camera, con- tinues right past us, then disappears into the distance. 

Torin asks: “But the lava?” 

Lycentia laughs: “Torin, that’s not lava! That’s Dreep’s supper dish!” Torin: “But what about my parents? And Boogle?” 

Lycentia: “Torin, I think it’s time for us all to go back home...to The Lands Above.”

You are Torin, a handsome lad of eighteen, wondering about your future. You’re expected to be a farmer—but secretly you long to be much more. But one summer morning you return home from “just another errand” to find your parents trapped in a magic spell! Fortunately a bystander tells you what happened: a sorceress appeared, cast a spell over your parents, then vanished. Learning little more than her name, you vow to find her, and force her to re- lease your parents from her evil deed. 

Thus begins your quest—but before it ends, you will travel deep into The Lands Below, through fantastic worlds filled with enemies, thwarting death again and again until a climatic confrontation with that evil sorceress changes your life in ways not even you have imagined! And, along the way you’ll learn everything in Torin’s Passage is not as it appears to be…including you! 

But, because this story is from Al Lowe, computer gaming’s best-selling humorist, be prepared to laugh as well. You’ll encounter not just deadly enemies, but Al’s patented semi-sharp wit, slapstick humor, and just plain silliness. And all of it G-rated, too! “I wanted to create a game to play with Megan, my 11-year-old daughter,” says Al. “A story that would interest both of us, although in different ways. And, a story that would make us both laugh out loud, although at different times!” 

Perfect for the entire family, Torin’s Passage is a game you’re sure to enjoy—with or without children.

Michel Legrand was born in Paris in 1932. A child prodigy, he entered the Paris Conservatory at the age of 11. When he was 20, he graduated as a solo pianist with top honors in composition. He studied extensively with Nadia Boulanger. Legrand also served as conductor and arranger for two of France’s brightest stars: Maurice Chevalier and Edith Piaf. 

Michel Legrand first attracted attention in the United States at the age of 22 with his recording of I Love Paris, which remained at the top of the album sales charts for several months during 1954. Since then he has stayed active as a recording artist, with more than 100 albums to his credit including Magic, his recording with Kiri Te Kanawa for the Warner label. 

Over the years Legrand has recorded with a lengthy list of pop, jazz and classical stars including such names as Barbra Streisand, Miles Davis, Frankie Laine, Stan Getz, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, Ray Charles and James Gal- way. He has worked with Frank Sinatra, Henry Mancini, Cleo Laine, Liza Minelli, Oscar Peterson, and Rosemary Clooney. Barbra Streisand’s 1988 album release Till I Loved You contained a new Legrand work, On My Way To You. The New York Times called the song a “haunting philosophical ballad” and deemed it one of the album’s high- lights. 

Just as Legrand seeks variety in his musical associations, he also looks for diversity in the kind of films he scores. Since he began composing for the screen in the mid-1950s, there is scarcely a film genre that has not borne the unique Legrand musical imprint, from Billie Holiday’s life story, Lady Sings The Blues to the breezy Forty Car- ats to Orson Welles’s F For Fake, from the lush, romantic The Other Side Of Midnight to the brooding Wuthering Heights and even to a James Bond entry, Never Say Never Again. 

But the films for which Legrand is best remembered are those for which he received Academy Award nomina- tions, an honor bestowed upon him sixteen times! In three instances, he carried home the coveted Oscar. His greatest recognition came in 1971 with The Summer of ‘42, for which he won Best Score. Its haunting song, The Summer Knows, went on to become a well-loved standard. In 1984, he clinched his third Academy Award for his score to Barbra Streisand’s musical Yentl, which was highly praised by Time Magazine. Nevertheless, his most unforgettable work was his first Academy Award winner: the classic 1964 film, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which has a place on almost any top ten list of great musicals. 

Michel Legrand has also contributed to numerous European films with great distinction, including such foreign classics as Lola, Jean-Luc Godard’s Une femme est une femme and Vivre sa vie, and Jacques Demy’s Bay of An- gels. 

Composer, pianist, songwriter and film director are just a few of the hats worn by the energetic Legrand. He is also a conductor of renown and a virtuoso jazz pianist. He has conducted the Minnesota Orchestra, the Buffalo Phil- harmonic and the symphony orchestras of Pittsburgh, Vancouver, Atlanta, Montreal, Denver and New Orleans. He is always enthusiastic about the classical concert world, both as a performer and as the composer of music for ballet, a violin concerto, an opera, and various works for piano and orchestra as well as solo piano. His latest record is Four Piano Blues, a collection of solo piano works by jazz-influenced classical American composers on the Erato label.

Several player-friendly features we want to add to Torin's Passage: 

·  The game watches the player’s actions. If he stands still for more than x seconds, he hears “If you don’t 

know what to do, use the help system.” This message is in both audio and a dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog is a check box with “Skip this message from now on.” 

·  On-line hints that cost you points. We keep a set of flags in the order that tells the story best, not neces-

sarily the “most-efficient” path. When they ask for help, a dialog appears with “This hint will cost you n points. Still want a hint?”, “Yes,” and “No,” and “Skip this warning from now on.” boxes. If they choose “Yes,” they hear the hint audio and, if the scroll-back buffer is On, it appears there too. A soundFX plays after the hint, and the point-O-meter rolls backwards. A big hand will appear on-screen, pointing in the direction they need to travel, or pointing at the object they need to click. 

·  A “Solve” menu item (or icon) that lets you skip past puzzles you don’t enjoy, don’t understand, or just 

find too difficult. You don’t get the points, and we make sure you worry you’re missing something cool, but at least you’re not stymied or frustrated. The icon would be grayed-out for most of the game, but when it’s active, it fast-forwards you past the current problem. Problem: how to keep people who skip things from complaining “this game’s too easy!” 

·  When the game starts up with a Microsoft-style “Tip of the Day.” Example, “A faster way to save your 

current game is by pressing Ctrl-S.” At the bottom of the dialog is a check box with “Show tips at startup.” A “Next Tip” button gives another. “OK” clears the Tip dialog. 

The marketing advantages here are: 

·  This makes it a real “family game.” Mom and Dad can play by themselves. A parent can play with a 

child. And, kids can play by themselves without the parent. 

·  It should appeal to the “mass market” that has never played an adventure game. The story remains 

solid, but if you want to avoid the puzzles, you can. When a new- or non-gamer ask the software clerk, “I’ve never played a game before, where do I start?”—Torin's Passage is it! 

But what about hintbook sales? 

·  Since we don’t actually show the solutions to the puzzles, perhaps there’s still a small market. To the 

extent the hintbook is a “the making of” book, there’s still a small market. Neither will contribute enough to keep hintbook revenues where they’ve been. 

·  BUT, since all the above features could be coded as independent modules and will compress way 

down, we could ship them on a floppy. Sell it for $9.95 as an “Integrated Hintbook,” or a “Digital Hintbook,” or a “Virtual Hintbook.” People wouldn’t have to “leave the game environment” to get the answers or bump they need.
